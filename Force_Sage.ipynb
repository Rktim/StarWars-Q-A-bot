Small in stature but revered for his wisdom and power, Yoda trained generations of Jedi, ultimately serving as the Jedi Order's Grand Master. He played integral roles in defending the Republic during the Clone Wars, survived Order 66, and lived to passed on the Jedi tradition to Luke Skywalker, and unlocking the path to immortality.\\nBorn in 896 BBY, Yoda served the Jedi Order for centuries, becoming Jedi Grand Master and helping to teach many younglings. During the High Republic Era, in 382 BBY, Yoda helped bring an end to a devastating battle between the Jedi and the anti-Jedi Path of the Open Hand cult. After the battle, which became known as the Night of Sorrow, he decided to keep the living weapons against Force-sensitives the Path had used, the Nameless, out of the Jedi Archives to protect the order. Over a century later, he took a sabbatical from the Jedi High Council to train Padawans aboard the Star Hopper, leading them and other Jedi in fighting the Nihil pirate organization in 232 BBY. After disappearing without explanation for over a year, Yoda reappeared in 230 BBY on Corellia, where he helped his former Padawan Kantam Sy and other Jedi battle the Nihil, accompanied by a former Jedi who fought in the Night of Sorrow named Azlin Rell. As the Nihil had also weaponized the Nameless, Yoda hoped that Rell's knowledge he had accrued about the creatures since the battle would help the Jedi find a way to fight them.\\nYoda was almost nine hundred years old in the latter days of the Republic. A leading member of the Jedi High Council, his contemporaries included other legendary Masters, such as Mace Windu and Ki-Adi-Mundi. During the Invasion of Naboo, in 32 BBY, the maverick Qui-Gon Jinn introduced Anakin Skywalker to the High Council, believing with absolute certainty that he had discovered the prophesied Chosen One. The Jedi elders sensed that the boy was full of fear and anger and declined to train him, deeming Skywalker too old and emotionally compromised to commit himself to the Jedi Code. After Jinn's death during the liberation of Naboo, the High Council reversed their decision in spite of Yoda's continued opposition to Skywalker's apprenticeship, having sensed grave danger in his training. At the same time, the Jedi discovered that their ancient nemesis, the Sith, had returned after a millennium in hiding. Aware of the Rule of Two, Yoda was convinced that at least one more Sith Lord remained active following Obi-Wan Kenobi's victory over the Sith apprentice Darth Maul.\\nOver the next decade, the galaxy was on the verge of civil war with entire star systems\\u2014led by Count Dooku, Yoda's one-time Padawan\\u2014threatening to secede from the Republic by 22 BBY. Unable to defend the entire Republic on their own, the Jedi took command of the newly-formed Grand Army of the Republic, with Yoda himself leading an army of clone troopers against the Separatist Droid Army of the Confederacy of Independent Systems in the first battle of the Clone Wars, rescuing the Jedi and Senator from execution. For three years Yoda led the Republic military's war effort as a Jedi General, determined to bring a swift and decisive end to the conflict. During this time he was approached by the spirit of Qui-Gon Jinn, who helped Yoda learn how to retain his identity as a spirit after death. Yoda's efforts against the Separatists were undermined by Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith who conspired to destroy the Jedi and restore the Sith to power. After the Great Jedi Purge commenced in 19 BBY, killing thousands of Jedi both on Coruscant and across the galaxy, Yoda confronted the self-declared Galactic Emperor but failed to cut short Sidious' reign and consequently retreated into exile, leaving the Sith Master to consolidate his power with a new apprentice, the former Anakin Skywalker-turned-Darth Vader, at his side. \\nYoda's remaining years were spent living in isolation on the remote world of Dagobah. After the death of Obi-Wan Kenobi, he was able to commune with his spirit, who wished for Yoda to train Anakin's son Luke Skywalker. Yoda initially reluctantly agreed, but later believed that the galaxy as better off without him and refused Kenobi's request. After being convinced by Kenobi to enter the Cave of Evil, in which he confronted many figures from his past and made peace with his failures, he agreed to teach Luke Skywalker, who soon after sought out the legendary Grand Master in the hope of becoming a Jedi Knight. He trained Skywalker for a time, until despite Yoda's warnings Skywalker hurriedly abandoned his training to save his friends after a having a vision that they were in danger. A year later, in 4 ABY, with his health rapidly declining, Yoda died of old age when Skywalker returned to see him. He became one with the Force, shortly before Luke redeemed his father Anakin, who fulfilled his destiny as the Chosen One by killing Sidious.\\nYears later, Luke Skywalker's attempt to reform the Jedi Order would be foiled when his nephew Ben Solo turned to the dark side and destroyed his Jedi Temple. Believing the galaxy was better without him and the Jedi, Skywalker went into exile, just as Yoda had. After his student he reluctantly trained, the scavenger Rey, also abandoned her training, Yoda appeared as a ghost to Skywalker. Yoda taught Skywalker to learn from his failures and helped him forgive himself.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Biography\\n\\n1.1 Early life\\n1.2 High Republic Era\\n\\n1.2.1 Early High Republic Era\\n1.2.2 An uncertain Path\\n1.2.3 Chancellor no more\\n1.2.4 The Night of Sorrow\\n1.2.5 Return to the Temple\\n1.2.6 Master of Kantam Sy\\n1.2.7 Time on the Star Hopper\\n1.2.8 Starlight Beacon\\n1.2.9 Disappearance\\n1.2.10 Return\\n1.2.11 Speaking with Rwoh\\n\\n\\n1.3 Master of Dooku\\n1.4 Pre-Invasion of Naboo\\n1.5 Invasion of Naboo\\n1.6 Separatist Crisis\\n1.7 The Clone Wars\\n\\n1.7.1 Battle of Geonosis\\n1.7.2 Mentoring Anakin Skywalker\\n1.7.3 Ambush on Rugosa\\n1.7.4 The Malevolence crisis\\n1.7.5 Gunray's capture\\n1.7.6 The Zillo Beast\\n\\n\\n1.8 Facing the rising darkness\\n\\n1.8.1 Attack on the Jedi Temple\\n1.8.2 Biochip conspiracy\\n1.8.3 The mystery of Sifo-Dyas\\n1.8.4 Discovering immortality\\n1.8.5 Utapau crystal crisis\\n1.8.6 The plan to assassinate Count Dooku\\n1.8.7 Last days of the Clone Wars\\n1.8.8 Order 66\\n\\n\\n1.9 The Age of the Empire\\n\\n1.9.1 Duel in the Senate\\n1.9.2 Exile\\n1.9.3 Helping the Spectres\\n1.9.4 The last Jedi\\n1.9.5 A phantom visitor\\n1.9.6 Haunted by Kenobi\\n1.9.7 Entering the Cave of Evil\\n1.9.8 Taking a new apprentice\\n1.9.9 A disturbance in the Force\\n1.9.10 Death\\n\\n\\n1.10 Postmortem and legacy\\n\\n\\n2 Personality and traits\\n3 Powers and abilities\\n\\n3.1 Lightsaber combat\\n3.2 Force powers\\n3.3 Other skills\\n\\n\\n4 Equipment\\n5 Behind the scenes\\n\\n5.1 The Original trilogy\\n5.2 The Prequel trilogy\\n5.3 Animated television shows\\n5.4 The Sequel trilogy\\n5.5 Discrepancies\\n5.6 Non-canon appearances\\n\\n\\n6 Appearances\\n\\n6.1 Non-canon appearances\\n\\n\\n7 Sources\\n\\n7.1 Non-canon sources\\n\\n\\n8 Notes and references\\n9 External links\\n\\n\\nBiography\\nEarly life\\n\\n\\\"For 800 years have I trained Jedi.\\\"\\n\\u2015Yoda, to Luke Skywalker[7]\\nBorn nine-hundred years before the Battle of Endor,[18] Yoda belonged to an ancient and mysterious species[4] and little was known of Yoda's early life;[19] he never revealed his homeworld.[1] As he was keenly attuned to the Force, he joined the Jedi Order as a youngling. After undergoing the ritual known as the Gathering, he received his kyber crystal, and Professor Huyang helped him construct his first lightsaber aboard the Crucible.[20][21] At some point during his time as a youngling, Yoda skipped across the lily pads in the Jedi Grand Temple's meditation pond.[22]\\nYoda was paired up with a personal mentor. During their time together, Yoda's Jedi Master told him the tale of K'ungfu and Chuang, two great Jedi of the past.[6] Around the age of 100, in 796 BBY,[2] Yoda was ready to pass on what he had learned. Having attained the rank of Master, he spent the next eight centuries training and tutoring generations of Jedi.[5] It was estimated that over his lifetime, he trained around twenty-thousand Jedi.[23]\\n\\nHigh Republic Era\\nEarly High Republic Era\\n\\n\\\"You must choose the Force. One does not fall into being a Jedi Knight by mistake, hm? Or because it is convenient! You must choose the Force, with your whole heart. To do this, you must learn, again, to listen. To hear the world, the world outside of your own emotions. Even when they are very, very loud, heh, [like] a hurricane.\\\"\\n\\u2015Yoda[24]\\nBy the High Republic Era, Yoda was considered a great Jedi Master. He had also gained a seat on the Jedi High Council[25] and the rank of Grand Master.[26] Two other Jedi\\u2014Xo Lahru and Pra-Tre Veter\\u2014shared the Grand Master title with Yoda.[27] Eventually the human Jedi Ry Ki-Sakka also attained the position.[28] As the Jedi who taught younglings, Yoda one day met the human youngling Gella Nattai, who was scared of the training remotes and ran from the room. Finding Nattai in the Temple garden and sitting with her, Yoda and Nattai watched a frog in the garden repeatedly try to jump into a waterfall behind a stone wall. Yoda used the frog as a lesson, teaching her to face her fear and always get back up to try again.[29]\\n\\nAn uncertain Path\\n\\n\\\"No one, no galaxy, no Republic, no Jedi Order, no family, is perfect.\\\"\\\"You are right. [\\u2026] Perhaps we are doing too much, too fast.\\\"\\\"You must continue. The great good is a good vision. Fight for this good as well, the Jedi do.\\\"\\n\\u2015Yoda and Chancellor Kyong Greylark[30]\\n     The Path of the Open Hand  \\nIn 382 BBY, after learning of the Battle of Jedha and the failure of a peace treaty between the warring planets Eiram and E'ronoh there, Yoda went to the Republic Executive Building on the galactic capital Coruscant to meet with with Supreme Chancellor Kyong Greylark while they waited for more information from Jedha. They spoke to Jedi Master Creighton Sun and Jedi Knight Aida Forte, who were on the ground on Jedha and confirmed that the E'roni ambassador was dead and the Eirami had deployed a droid army. They requested to perform an investigation on the Outer Rim Territories planet Dalna of the Path of the Open Hand cult, considering their involvement in the failure of the peace talks, the fact that Jedi Master Silandra Sho felt a disturbance that made the Jedi ill at the Path's almshouse, and that Jedi Knight Gella Nattai believed the Chancellor's criminal son Axel Greylark was working with the Path. Yoda admitted that he had sensed a disturbance beyond Jedha, and emphasized that they need to be careful, reminding them that there was always those who thrived in chaos. After much deliberation, Yoda and Chancellor Greylark eventually agreed to a fact-finding mission accompanied by two of her guards and to send Jedi Master Char-Ryl-Roy and Padawan Enya Keen to Eiram and E'ronoh to try and keep the peace and discover what was causing communications buoys to be down, Yoda explaining to them that Werth Plouth, the Path's Herald, was responsible for the riots on Jedha.[30]\\nAfter the communication ended, Yoda expressed his concern as they received another message from Jedi Master Yaddle, who was accompanied by a Jedi Initiate named Cippa Tarko, though the connection of the message was poor. Tarko asked about Yoda, and Yaddle explained that he was a Jedi Master and not her brother. Yoda told Yaddle that they were sending help to Jedha and two Jedi to Dalna and that she was to return to Coruscant, but the message was so choppy they were not sure if she understood. Yoda had an unsettling feeling in the Force that reminded him of the feeling he got whenever a battle was coming. Master Yaddle did misunderstand Yoda's message to mean she was needed on Dalna and joined Sun and Forte there, who sent a message to Yoda confirming they were there shortly before Yaddle arrived.[30]\\n\\n     Jedi Master Yaddle  \\nLater, Chancellor Greylark had her guards summon Yoda to her to reveal that her son Axel had escaped from prison with the help of the Path and someone named Binnot Ullo. She told Yoda that she did not know who Ullo was and did not think Axel had many friends. He assured her that no one, no galaxy, and no republic was perfect, and that she should continue to fight for the greater good like the Jedi did. She explained that she felt like they have all been moving through a fog that has corrupted everything lately and Yoda insisted that Axel still had good in him and that the 'fog' was just corrupting him too. However, the Chancellor resolved to make Axel truly feel the consequences of his actions.[30]\\n\\nChancellor no more\\n\\n\\\"We will go together. Chancellor you may not be anymore. Friend, you still are.\\\"\\n\\u2015Yoda to Greylark, on going to Dalna[30]\\n     Chancellor Kyong Greylark  \\nEventually, Greylark received a message from her son on Dalna and immediately called Yoda to have him listen to it with her via hologram. After hearing Axel ask for her to go to Dalna to speak with the Path and with him, Yoda asked her what she would do, the Chancellor deciding to go to Dalna. She then recorded a message for Axel that included Yoda in it, wearing a blank expression, so that he could bear witness to her stepping down as Chancellor. After she sent the message, Yoda stayed with her wordlessly for a while, and she appreciated his kindness.[30]\\nBefore Greylark could leave for Dalna, Yoda approached her and said that since he had not heard back from Masters Sun or Ela Sutan, who had also been sent to Dalna, that he would go with her because she was still his friend even though she was no longer Chancellor. Yoda had a Jedi Longbeam cruiser follow them with a contingent of Jedi. While in hyperspace, they received a distress call from Princess Xiri A'lbaran of E'ronoh and Prince Phan-tu Zenn of Eiram. They then received a message from Chancellor Orlen Mollo, who said that the leaders of Eiram and E'ronoh were still not cooperating. Yoda volunteered to rescue the heirs due to their proximity to them and left, taking other Jedi with him.[30]\\n\\nThe Night of Sorrow\\n\\n\\\"Speak to the Jedi Council soon, you should. We must explain the happenings on Dalna. All that went wrong.\\\" [\\u2026] \\\"But we must also speak to all the things that went right. We could not have defeated the Path without the Jedi.\\\"\\\"And the Jedi could not have defeated the Path without the help of our Republic allies.\\\"\\n\\u2015Yoda and Greylark[30]\\nEventually, Yoda arrived at the battle that was now raging on Dalna between the Path and the Jedi, which came to be known as the Night of Sorrow.[30] The Path, much of it reorganized into the Path of the Closed Fist, was led by Marda Ro of the Ro family.[31] He was joined by Princess A'lbaran and Prince Zenn, the three announcing that the combined forces of Eiram and E'ronoh were there to fight together with the Jedi. When Yoda arrived on the ground at the Path compound, Jedi Gella Nattai told him to direct people to go to the cave system as there was potentially many more Path members there.[30] On Dalna, he met[32] Path Little[31] Tromak. Yoda eventually came to forget Tromak but always remembered the importance of his visit to Dalna.[32]\\n\\n     The Path's compound on Dalna  \\nAs the battle started to come to a close with it turning in the Jedi's favor, Yoda and Yaddle stood together, the latter watching Cippa Tarko sleep. However, A'lbaran and Zenn contacted them and informed them that explosions have been set off underground. As Yaddle suggested getting help, the ground shook and Yoda spotted sections of the caves collapse into sinkholes. Yoda and Yaddle then sensed a Jedi in distress and went to help. Finding a door in the ground, Yoda and Yaddle connected to the force and sensed Gella Nattai and Axel Greylark. Yaddle lifted up the ground, rocks, and soil while Yoda lifted the water to try and rescue them. Enya Keen then ran toward them, seeing Nattai, and pulled her and Axel from the mud-like water, having been brought to the surface by the two Jedi Masters. Yoda and Yaddle then set the water and mud down far away. In the sinkhole, E'roni and Eirami soldiers began recovering survivors. Yaddle noticed that the sounds of battle have faded and the sun was rising. She asks Yoda if the battle was done, and he says it was.[30]\\nYoda met with Kyong Greylark and Chancellor Mollo on a medical frigate above Coruscant, the three discussing now only having one Chancellor instead of two and what it means. Yoda suggested they speak to the Jedi Council and tell them everything that went wrong, but Greylark also wanted to focus all the things that went right, including the help of the Republic and the Jedi. Mollo revealed that the people of Dalna were calling the event the Night of Sorrow. While he imagined the future, Greylark assured Yoda that she would meet him on Coruscant soon, Yoda adding that there was much to celebrate and remember.[30]\\n\\nReturn to the Temple\\n\\n\\\"What do you know about these nameless creatures?\\\"\\\"I, too, know of them. Powerful beings, they are. Dangerous, they are. But in pain, they could be. Only a few understand them. You, and I. And still, much to learn is there.\\\"\\n\\u2015Yoda and Creighton Sun[30]\\n     One of the Nameless creatures during the Night of Sorrow  \\nYoda then traveled to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, confirming first that the royal families of Eiram and E'ronoh had already gathered, who he met with when he arrived. He met with several Jedi, including Yaddle, who was standing with Tarko. Yoda raised his arm to silence the room and Master Sun rose from his chair, walking to the center of the room using a walking stick before beginning a funeral for Jedi Aida Forte, Orin Darhga, and Char-Ryl-Roy. Yoda allowed Roy's former Padawan, Keen, to keep his lightsaber and use it alongside hers.[30]\\nLater, in the Jedi Archives, Creighton spoke with Yoda about Nameless creatures that the Path deployed on Dalna and the horror they wrought upon the Jedi, causing them to be weakened, hallucinate, and eventually be turned to dust. Yoda confirmed that there is a larger danger connected to them, which caused Creighton to wonder what Yoda knew. Realizing how catastrophic to the Order it could be if people found out about the creatures, and since they had heard no other reports of their usage, they decided to keep quiet about them and not include them in the Jedi Archive. They agreed not to speak of it again and each of them left.[30]\\n\\nMaster of Kantam Sy\\n\\n\\\"The lesson of Younglings we take on is one of the hardest ones for most Jedi to learn. Indeed, some never do.\\\"\\\"Detachment.\\\"\\\"To let go. Elusive it is, but also, always available to us, always there. And then, when we grasp, gone again. Takes practice, it does. Repetition. To have to do it again does not mean we have failed, only that we must do it again. And again.\\\"\\n\\u2015Yoda and Kantam Sy[24]\\n     Yoda held the title of Grand Master of the Jedi Order since the days of the High Republic Era.  \\nAt some point, Yoda took on a human named Kantam Sy as his Padawan. The two were stationed at the Jedi Temple on the planet Endovar. Sy was a very talented Padawan and was far ahead of their peers and even some of their elders, with Yoda even admitting that they were the most disciplined Padawan he had ever taught and one of the most connected to the Force. Despite this, Yoda held off knighting Sy, for a reason that the Padawan did not understand until they began a romantic relationship with an acrobat named Aytar and realized that both Yoda and them had been waiting for something like that to happen. Eventually, Sy decided to leave the Jedi Order, a decision partially incited by their newfound relationship with Aytar.[24]\\nYoda and Sy loved to spar with each other, and it was how the two often found understanding and how Sy often found inner harmony while troubled or when they had a problem. Even when they did not find a solution during a match, they would leave feeling like an answer was out there. When Sy traveled to the meditation room in the Endovar Jedi Temple in order to tell Yoda about their decision, Yoda challenged them to a sparring match, remembering that they had dueled many times in that room and saying that this duel could be one final lesson. Sy agreed to the duel, as it was custom to not refuse a duel with Master Yoda, but also realized that this meant Yoda knew about their decision. Yoda dodged Sy's question by engaging in combat, before saying that the time had come to make a choice, but not the one that Sy thought. Yoda explained that the Force chose Sy just as it had chosen all other Jedi, and asked when Sy would choose the Force. Sy insisted that they chose the Force every day when they took part in their Jedi training, but after knocking Sy to the ground, Yoda asked if we really make a choice when we do not believe there are any other options. Yoda told Sy that there was a reason he had not knighted them yet, before ending the duel, helping Sy up, and sitting down with Sy to meditate.[24]\\nEventually Sy asked Yoda if they should leave the Jedi Order, but Yoda insisted that there was no 'should' and that the right thing to do is an idea we invent to make ourselves feel better. Yoda also suggested that Sy had stopped listening, in the literal sense, and in a larger general sense. Yoda explained that feelings are like wind, we can feel it, we can experience it, but it passes, though sometimes it can feel like a hurricane which can make it easy to give in to anger and fear. Yoda told Sy that in order for them to continue to be a Jedi they must actively choose the Jedi Order and the Force and learn to listen to the world outside of their emotions even when they were as loud as a hurricane. Eventually, after a moment, Sy set down their lightsaber in front of Yoda. Yoda nodded at them, and then his Padawan left him, and the Jedi Order, behind. Yoda was saddened but supported Sy through their departure. Sy would reflect on the conversation they had that day throughout the rest of their life.[24]\\nOver a year later, Sy returned to the Jedi, and met with Yoda on the Endovar. Yoda was in the process of helping a pet Happabore named Monsalmo at the time, after being awoken from a nap by the creature's squealing. Yoda was used to dealing with her complicated behaviors, including finding her inside the temple underneath the younglings' bunks. This time, Monsalmo was pregnant and had climbed onto the roof of her pen to avoid giving birth in a fuel spill. However, the roof could not hold the creature's weight and it collapsed. Yoda caught Monsalmo with the Force, but at that same time she started to give birth to her pups, so Yoda had to carry them with the Force too. Just then, Sy and a Force-sensitive girl they had rescued on the planet Naboo named Lula Talisola arrived and both used the Force to help Yoda carry Monsalmo and her pups. Yoda welcomed Sy back, telling them that they had left a Padawan and returned a Knight. A few hours later, Yoda knighted Sy in a modest ceremony so that they could take on Talisola as their Padawan learner.[24]\\nAfter the ceremony, Sy and Yoda sat around a fire near the happabore enclosure and discussed the events that had occurred. Sy expressed that they did not understand how one second they felt so sure in their path separate from the Order but was then pulled back to it when they saved Talisola. Yoda explained that the young are the greatest teachers and the greatest lesson that can be learned from them is necessity of detachment and letting go, that being a Jedi was to let go. Sy realized that they had been the one that taught Yoda that lesson. Yoda revealed that he had struggled with Sy's departure and had been unsure of the future. The two then shared Sweetpuff jamwiches with Talisola.[24]\\n\\n     Yoda and Kantam Sy speak with Lula Talisola.  \\nSometime later, Yoda and Sy met with Talisola in the Endovar Jedi temple. Sy told Talisola that the lesson she taught the two masters was the hardest one of all. Talisola hoped that it was front flips with a lightsaber, which made Sy retract their statement and say that it was the second hardest lesson to learn. Yoda concurred, saying that the front flip was nothing simple. But the lesson that Sy wanted to teach Talisola was the same one that Sy had learned from her and Yoda had learned from Sy: Detachment.[33]\\nSometime before 232 BBY,[34] Yoda traveled to the Jedi temple on Takodana to pick up a Force-sensitive Aloxian child named Qort from Maz Kanata and Jedi Sav Malag\\u00e1n and bring him into the Jedi Order.[35] Padawan Reath Silas briefly met Yoda during some events both attended together.[24]\\n\\nTime on the Star Hopper\\n\\n\\\"Chaos on the surface, there will be. Remember that the Force moves through you, through all living things, even in chaos. Move with the Force, we must. Never against it.\\\"\\n\\u2015Yoda during the Trymant IV disaster[36]\\nBy 232 BBY,[37] Yoda was stationed alongside Master Zia Zaldor Zanna at the Jedi Grand Temple on Coruscant assigning youngling Jedi Initiates to different temple outposts across the galaxy to continue learning and training under their teachers. Here he met initiates Kai Brightstar, Lys Solay, and Nubs; Yoda gifted Brightstar his own training saber after Brightstar sacrificed his to save Nubs while on a mission.[38] Later that year,[39] Yoda took a sabbatical from the Jedi Council,[25] having felt the Force needed him on a different path. Thus, Yoda joined[26] the crew of the Jedi Padawan Academic Cruiser Star Hopper, allowing him to help train Padawans[36] and younglings.[25] Yoda was also therefore able to help train Talisola, who was stationed aboard the Star Hopper.[36]\\nYoda appointed the Mon Calamari Jedi Master Ephru Shinn to hold his seat on the council while he was away. During the Great Hyperspace Disaster in the Hetzal system, Jedi Master Avar Kriss established a Force network, which was eventually aided by Jedi who were outside the system. Yoda\\u2014located somewhere with the crew of younglings he was currently teaching\\u2014helped the effort, adding his focus to the network to ensure a Tibanna gas container did not collide with an R-class sun.[25]\\n\\n     Yoda, Torban Buck, and Lula Talisola fight the Nihil on Trymant IV.  \\nThe Great Hyperspace Disaster also caused the Emergences, which were when giant pieces of debris exited hyperspace in various places throughout the galaxy and threatened to hit planets at near lightspeed. Eventually, the Trymant system was threatened by an Emergence. The staff of Republic Security Zone Monitoring Satellite 777B-Alpha reported the incident to the Starlight Beacon space station, who then asked the only Republic or Jedi ship immediately within range, the Star Hopper, to assist. Onboard was Yoda along with fellow Jedi Master Torban Buck and a class of Padawans. As they traveled through hyperspace to the Trymant system, Yoda told the Padawans to prepare for anything because they had no idea what was coming, but that the Force would reveal all. When they received the information that they were the only Republic or Jedi ship nearby to respond, one of the Padawans suggested that they stay back and wait for backup. But Yoda insisted that they were Trymant's only hope and needed to press forward. Shortly before they exited hyperspace Yoda had the Padawans report what information they had discovered about the calamity. Yoda and Buck decided to stay on the Star Hopper to use the Force to divert the biggest pieces of debris but sent the Padawans in Rescue speeders to help on the surface of the planet.[36]\\nHowever, amid the chaos of the Emergence, a Spider Cruiser called the Squall Spider commanded by the Eye of the Nihil, Marchion Ro arrived in Bralanak City to pick up Elder Tromak, whom Ro wanted the services of to find some information. When the Padawans attempted to get Nihil marauders to allow them to use the Spider Cruiser to evacuate civilians, a fight broke out,[36] leading Yoda and Buck to the surface to help the young Jedi and fight against the Nihil. During the fight, a Force-sensitive civilian named Zeen Mrala who had helped the Jedi against the Emergence and against the Nihil, told Masters Yoda and Buck that her friend Krix Kamerat had been captured by the Nihil and needed to be rescued. Lula Talisola offered to go, but Yoda insisted that he would go rescue the boy. Master Buck protested, believing that he was not a fighting Jedi and therefore should not be left to lead the Jedi, but Yoda ignored him. Yoda then protected the group of Jedi from a large plasma projectile lobbed at them by a Nihil marauder by cutting it into pieces with his lightsaber while it was still in the air. Yoda then left to find Kamerat, but first asked Mrala to take her pet Cru Cham Cham with him.[40]\\n\\n     Yoda discovers a piece of the Nameless control rod on a Nihil ship.  \\nMarchion Ro knew of Yoda and his power, and when he saw him on the planet told his subordinates to keep the Jedi Master away from the Squall Spider, but Yoda managed to sneak aboard the ship nonetheless. Yoda eventually found Kamerat and told him that they needed to leave quickly. Yoda told Kamerat that Mrala had sent him and proved it by showing him Cham Cham. Yoda then gave Kamerat a Holoprojector that he told the boy he could reach out to Mrala with when he was ready. However, Kamerat shortly after alerted the pirates that Yoda was aboard. Having been raised by the Elders of the Path,[40] a religious order descended from the Path of the Open Hand[41] that distrusted Force-sensitives[32] due to believing the Force should only be appreciated from a distance, as if it was a fire,[36], only to see that his best friend Zeen Mrala had secretly been Force-sensitive and never told him, Kamerat felt betrayed and ended up siding with the Nihil because of that sense of betrayal. With the Nihil looking for him, Yoda ran from the marauders but uncovered that the Nihil had[40] a strange, purple artifact[32] in a storage crate. Yoda hoped to escape quietly but Cham Cham made a loud cry that alerted the Nihil to their location and lead to a confrontation. Yoda escaped and met up with Mrala, revealing to her that Cham Cham had eaten several Nihil limbs in the confrontation. Yoda then told Mrala that she needed to come with them to Starlight Beacon. When she asked why he had not saved Kamerat, Yoda told her that he could not save someone who did not want to be rescued. With the Nihil drive from Trymant, Yoda, Torban Buck, Zeen Mrala, and the Padawans traveled to Starlight Beacon in the Star Hopper.[40]\\n\\nStarlight Beacon\\n\\n\\\"For light and life!\\\"\\\"For light and life!\\\"\\n\\u2015Yoda and the gathered Jedi, during the dedication of Starlight Beacon[42]\\nFollowing the Battle of Kur, Yoda went with fellow Grand Master Pra-Tre Veter to Starlight Beacon. The two had a meeting with the Supreme Chancellor Lina Soh to discuss Bacta manufacturing for the relief effort for the Great Disaster, being in need of the right crops after what had occurred on Hetzal. But before their meeting, they visited the hub of the beacon to meet with Master Avar Kriss, and revealed to her that the council had convened and named her the Marshal of Starlight Beacon. Kriss also asked Yoda if he was returning to the council, but Yoda clarified that he was not finished on the Star Hopper.[26] Yoda later attended the Beacon's dedication ceremony, where he said a few words about the dedication plaque which was placed in a stone monument. He talked with Kai Brightstar, Lys Solay, Nash Durango, and Nubs, mentioning their adventure trying to get the dedication plaque after it was stolen by the pirate Taborr Val Dorn, who was secretly Prince Cyrus Vuundir of Vuundalla. He told them how proud he is of them and encouraged them to join the rest of the Jedi for Lina Soh's speech. After the Jedi left, Yoda spoke with Prince Vuundir, who was no longer in his pirate disguise, telling him that he sensed much conflict in him but that he still had the potential for greatness if he made the right choices. Yoda told Cyrus that the future was in his hands. Joining with his fellow Jedi, he raised his lightsaber and declared \\\"For light and life.\\\"[42]\\n\\n     Yoda discusses Zeen Mrala and the Nihil's secrets with Estala Maru and Avar Kriss.  \\nAfter about a week, Zeen Mrala started settling in on Starlight very well, so Masters Yoda, Avar Kriss, Kantam Sy, Estala Maru, and Torban Buck all went to check up on her and discuss her plans, with Yoda even bringing pastry treats. The Masters deliberated and determined that she was too old to begin Jedi training and most likely could not be sent back to Trymant. Master Sy suggested that she should stay with them temporarily, as she had proved herself valuable, which Yoda acknowledged was an excellent point. They did decide to let her stay, partially with the hope that she could be helpful against the Nihil. When it became clear that finding the Nihil would be a challenge, Yoda revealed that he had given a holoprojector to Kamerat and one to Mrala. Mrala confirmed that they had had communications, which she apologized for, but Yoda denied her apology and said that she might have just saved the day. Yoda explained that they could use the holoprojectors to track the Nihil, but would have to be relatively close. Yoda was determined to find the Nihil to figure out what the mysterious artifact he had found was. The Jedi decided to travel to the Bright Jewel system, as there had been recent Nihil activity there, and see if they could pick up a signal.[43]\\n\\n     Yoda flies a Jedi Vector in the Battle in the Bright Jewel system.  \\nIn the Bright Jewel system, a routine got into a skirmish with a group of Nihil raiders, who alerted the Republic Outpost on Ord Mantell. Yoda, Torban Buck, Kantam Sy, and many other Jedi flew Jedi Vectors out of the outpost to confront the Nihil. The conflict erupted into an all out battle. Eventually all of the Nihil fighters were defeated, but Yoda was concerned, as he thought that it was too easy and that there therefore might be something wrong. Then the Jedi received a distress signal that they first believed was from the Ord Mantell base, until Yoda suspected that it was not actually from the base. They determined the signal to be from the junk moon Quantxi, and so Yoda ordered the Jedi to travel to the moon and send for backup from Starlight Beacon, though he also worried that they were too late.[44]\\n\\nDisappearance\\n\\n\\\"Master Yoda is still missing. As you all know, he was my Master when I was a Padawan and I wish he were here too. But he told us not to follow him and we must trust the Force on this.\\\"\\n\\u2015Kantam Sy[12]\\n     Yoda and Elder Tromak's shuttle is shot down over Vrant Tarnum.  \\nYoda journeyed to the junk moon of Quantxi with Masters Torban Buck and Kantam Sy to aid the Padawans of the Star Hopper against the Nihil force stationed there. However, Yoda crossed paths with Elder Tromak, who had escaped the Nihil after being escorted off Trymant IV with Kamerat by Ro, after landing. Yoda recognized him from Trymant. Tromak offered the Jedi bogaranths to ride to the Nihil, clarifying that even though he hated Jedi, they had a common enemy. As Masters Sy and Buck saddled up onto the bogaranths, Tromak pulled Yoda aside. Reminding Yoda of their meeting on Dalna years prior, he asked the Grand Master to journey with him to Kharvashark Ruins on Vrant Tarnum to stop the Nihil from recovering the second half of the mysterious artifact, with Yoda informing Tromak that the Nihil already had half of the weapon. However, Tromak was inistent on keeping the artifact's location a secret, so he told Yoda that he could not bring his comlink. Yoda agreed to this, and after sending one last message to the other Jedi telling them not to follow him, the two traveled to the Stygmarn system above Vrant Tarnum. However, the two encountered a network of drones and were shot down, allowing Ro a to acquire the other half of the artifact.[32]\\nTo the Jedi Order at large, Yoda was suddenly missing in action.[45] As the Drengir crisis and conflict with the Nihil dragged on, Yoda's name became one of the many mentioned alongside Jedi who had gone missing or died during the conflicts.[46] He was still missing by the time of the attack on Valo[45] and ensuing Battle of Grizal,[12] which both marked major escalations in tensions in the struggle between the Republic and the Nihil. In the latter engagement, Ro unleashed the living weapon known as the Great Leveler against the Jedi for the first time, using the completed artifact to control it.[47] Remembering that Yoda told them and Buck not to follow him, Sy told the Star Hopper's Padawans, after they asked whether they could go searching for the missing Jedi Master, that they needed to trust in the Force.[12] But Yoda's departure affected the Star Hopper's close crew in an incredibly deep way.[24]\\n\\n     Amid the stress of the Nihil conflict, the Jedi of Starlight Beacon use one of Yoda's recipes to come together and better understand each other.  \\nDuring the skirmish on Xais, Master Avar Kriss recalled Yoda's wisdom when Master Sskeer started to utilize extreme violence again, remembering him frequently saying that once you walk to the dark path it's forever in your heart.[48] Sometime later, Masters Kantam Sy and Torban Buck gathered a group of Jedi to bake Master Yoda's recipe for special baked sweet story custard cakes. The Masters claimed that the recipe specifically stated that the only way for the cakes to come out correctly is if the bakers told a story about cooperation while baking them, one in which they expanded their knowledge of what they were capable of, found trust in another person, or found a deeper understanding of the Force.[49]\\nLater, when Sy was assigned to investigate Nihil activity on Corellia with Master Cohmac Vitus, Sy mentioned that the young were the greatest teachers they could have, besides Master Yoda. This prompted Vitus to ask if there was any word on the old Jedi Master, to which Sy explained that they could not feel him, but that it did not necessarily mean anything. Sy expressed their belief that if Yoda had died, they all would have felt it, but Cohmac was still concerned with how long he had been gone despite that. Sy also lamented that it felt like everything happening would be much easier to make sense of if Yoda were there. Later, at Vitus's asking, Sy revealed to him that Master Yoda had let them do a walkabout of the Jedi Order, as he knew if he did not it would have been the end of things between Sy and the Order, with Sy even telling Vitus the entire story including Yoda's influence during the day they left and the day they returned to the Order. Cohmac also told Sy that they wondered what Yoda would make of everything that was happening.[24]\\nAfter the Battle at Dol'har Hyde, an engagement that saw the capture of Nihil leader Krix Kamerat and his detainment aboard the Star Hopper, Zeen Mrala and Lula Talisola visited Yoda's old quarters on the ship and reflected on the Jedi Master. Mrala missed him in a way that she thought was only possible to miss someone you had known your whole life, and especially missed the Jedi's welcoming presence and his laughing face. She thought that they needed Yoda's help more than ever since they had captured Kamerat. Mrala asked Talisola if she thought Yoda was ever coming back, and Talisola declared that he definitely was and that he would not want them to be standing there worrying about him.[24]\\nPadawans Reath Silas and Ram Jomaram also reflected on Yoda's disappearance while on Corellia, with Silas saying that he seemed like he would have been a \\\"pretty fun\\\" Master to Kantam Sy and that he remembered being able to feel Yoda's wisdom from a mile away. Both were Padawans were plagued with anxiety over Yoda's disappearance and imagined nightmare scenarios about what happened to him, which they admitted to each other. Silas mused that if Yoda were there, he would have said \\\"Forgive himself, a Jedi must, mm? Not being ruled by fear does not mean not feeling any fear at all, mm!\\\" which Jomaram thought sounded very accurate.[24]\\n\\nReturn\\n\\n\\\"To do this, though, to forge our path to the future, guided by the secrets of the past, we will be.\\\"\\n\\u2015Yoda[24]\\nConcurrent to the destruction of Starlight Beacon, Sy, Vitus, Jomaram, Silas, and Mrala joined Corellian bodyguards and civilians in fighting Nihil who were attempting to steal a fleet of MPO-1400 Purgill-class star cruisers and Republic Longbeam cruisers from the shipyards in Coronet City on Corellia in order to add to the chaos and destruction of the space station. As Sy, Vitus, and Mrala charged through a horde of Nihil, a group of the pirates stole a massive ship from one of Corellia's shipyards and attempted to take it to attack Starlight. However, the three Force-sensitives used the Force to stall the trawler and prevent it from escaping, but they had a weak hold on it and as they did Nihil reinforcements arrived. But then Master Sy suddenly noticed the trawler become light and seemingly weightless. And then the remaining Nihil war cloud was swept away suddenly, confusing the pirates, but also revealing Master Yoda in hooded robes holding the trawler with the Force with his lightsaber ignited at his side.[24]\\nYoda told Sy that it seemed like they needed a hand, and Sy collapsed and started cry at the sight of their old Master. Yoda then used the Force to send the massive ship crashing onto the horde of Nihil reinforcements with a fiery explosion. When more Nihil came, Yoda threw himself into their leader feet first and then used the Force to knock the others down with a single hand motion. This inspired Sy, who shouted \\\"For light and life\\\" before joining up with Vitus and Mrala again and fighting by Yoda's side. Yoda and Sy worked together to take down a Nihil with a buzz saw, Sy knocking him off balance before Yoda stabbed him in the back with his lightsaber. The Jedi then regrouped with the Corellian fighters and Yoda shouted the rallying cry \\\"For light and life\\\" which spread throughout the crowd. Eventually they managed to drive the Nihil away, winning the battle.[24]\\n\\n     The Nameless (pictured) emerged as a massive threat to the Jedi Order, but Yoda's quest for answers brought him to Azlin Rell who had had a connection to the beings.  \\nAfterward, Jomaram, who had been instrumental to the Jedi's success elsewhere in the battle, reunited with Sy, who introduced him to Yoda. Yoda said that they had much to discuss and not enough time, to which Sy added that they needed a place to go where they could regroup safely and debrief. Alys \\\"Crash\\\" Ongwa, one of the leaders of the Corellian fighters offered up a location to the Jedi. The group, including Yoda, ended up taking refuge in the hideaway of Baynoo Ongwa, Crash Ongwa's mother, in The Green on Corellia, riding various ships and airspeeders to get there. There, they were joined by a mysterious hooded individual,[24] the former Jedi Knight Azlin Rell,[50] who had accompanied Yoda. Rell did not sho his face or speak to anyone, and only constantly quietly sang the nursery rhyme 'Shrii ka rai ka rai',[24] which had a connection to the Nameless,[51] over and over again. Yoda declared that there was much to explain without actually explaining anything, but nobody questioned him under the assumption that there would be time to do so later. The group ate, bathed, and then tried to sleep.[24]\\nWhile they slept, all of the Force-sensitives were awoken in the middle of the night by sensing the final crash and destruction of Starlight Beacon in the Force. After feeling the death of Jedi Orla Jareni aboard Starlight Beacon, Master Cohmac Vitus gathered Yoda, the other Jedi, Zeen Mrala, and his Padawan Reath Silas. Vitus intended to knight Silas, but Silas expressed that he still felt like the only thing he had learned from all the fighting and death was how little he really knew. But Yoda commended this, saying that it was perhaps one of the hardest and most important lessons to learn. Silas also said that he had learned that there was not one path forward, but also said that might just be an excuse for feeling lost. Yoda assured him that it was impossible to be lost when there was not one right way forward. After more questions from Silas, Yoda then asked jokingly if he thought all of those Masters that thought he was ready were wrong. This prompted Silas to say he was ready, and together Masters Yoda, Vitus, and Sy knighted Reath Silas. But Master Vitus then handed his lightsaber to Silas, and after exchanging nods with Yoda, left the house, and left the Jedi Order for good.[24]\\nThe next morning, Yoda and Sy chatted and readied to leave, while Zeen Mrala reflected on the moment that Yoda had joined the battle with joy and inspiration. Yoda walked up to Crash Ongwa and Deemus Abrus, who had helped the Jedi before the battle, and wished them farewell. Yoda told the two that a new threat had arisen and that all of the Jedi needed to return to Jedi Temple on Coruscant, prompting Sy to reveal that the recall signal that Yoda had asked for had been sent out minutes earlier. Yoda explained that the way forward would be difficult, but that they would manage to find a way by being guided by the secrets of the past.[24] Part of this involved Rell, whose years of research on the Nameless Yoda hoped could help them learn how to fight or stop the beasts.[50]\\n\\nSpeaking with Rwoh\\n\\n\\\"Sorry to disturb you, Master. We need to talk.\\\"\\n\\u2015Vernestra Rwoh to Yoda[52]\\nIn 132 BBY, Jedi Master Vernestra Rwoh approached Yoda to speak with him after she had interrogated a memory-wiped Mae-ho Aniseya.[53]\\n\\nMaster of Dooku\\n\\n\\\"Perhaps the best Padawan of your generation, you were.\\\"\\\"Are you resorting to flattery, Master Yoda? Besides, I recall getting into more trouble than any other Padawan of my generation.\\\"\\\"Yes. And a valuable perspective, this gives you.\\\"\\n\\u2015Yoda and Dooku reflect on their time together as master and apprentice[54]\\n     Yoda was the Jedi Master of Count Dooku, who ultimately renounced his commitment to the Jedi Order.  \\nSeveral decades later,[55] Yoda took on the human Dooku as his last known Padawan in the era of the Galactic Republic.[14] In 90 BBY,[56] Yoda undertook a visit to Serenno with other Jedi Masters and younglings Sifo Dyas, and Dooku. Yoda later took Dooku on as an apprentice in[57] 86 BBY,[58] and while Dooku initially wanted to become the Padawan of Lene Kostana, his disappointment subsided when he learned he would be Yoda's apprentice. Once on a visit to Serenno, Master and apprentice together, Dooku's father shouted at the Grand Master for bringing his son to the planet, holding a dislike for the Jedi Order and Force-sensitives.[57] During one mission to the Wookiee homeworld of Kashyyyk, Dooku witnessed his master face off with a giant, dreadful terentatek.[59] Decades after his apprentice graduated to Knighthood,[57] in 42 BBY,[60] Yoda was informed by Dooku that he was departing from the Jedi Order, much to his disappointment, and when his former student offered to turn over his lightsaber, the Grandmaster allowed him to retain ownership of his weapon.[57]\\n\\nPre-Invasion of Naboo\\nYoda visited Kashyyyk on several other occasions prior to the Battle of Kashyyyk, serving as Jedi negotiator in many incidents involving the Wookiees and their Trandoshan neighbors. This earned him the ancient title of \\\"Defender of the Home Tree,\\\" as well as becoming a member of many Wookiee leaders' and all the inhabitants of Kachirho's honor families.[61]\\nYoda also taught outside the Master/Padawan relationship, and trained all the Jedi younglings prior to their teaming up with Jedi Masters,[62] including Master Obi-Wan Kenobi.[63] Since his days as a youngling, Mace Windu, a human who would eventually rise to become part of the Jedi Council, never responded well to the Grand Master's humor, which became one of the reasons Yoda continued to use his humor.[64] Kanan Jarrus, as Caleb Dume, often heard Yoda counsel, \\\"Do, or do not. There is no try.\\\"[65] He also taught groups of younglings in the basics of Jedi training,[14] including lightsaber instruction. He oversaw younglings undergoing the Gathering to find their own kyber crystals;[66] on one such occasion, he told youngling Ahsoka Tano of how she would know her crystal when she saw it. With these words in mind, Tano successfully found her crystal. At another point, he taught Tano of how one could find things they were not purposely looking for.[67]\\n\\nInvasion of Naboo\\n\\n\\\"There's no doubt the mysterious warrior was a Sith.\\\"\\\"Always two, there are. No more, no less. A master and an apprentice.\\\"\\\"But which one was destroyed, the master or the apprentice?\\\"\\n\\u2015Mace Windu and Yoda, about Darth Maul\\u00a0\\u2014  Listen (file info)[9]\\n     Yoda was a leading member of the Jedi High Council during the last years of the Galactic Republic.  \\nBy the invasion of the planet Naboo by the Trade Federation, Yoda still served on the Jedi High Council,[9] yet he was the sole Grand Master of the Jedi Order. By the invasion, he had been training Jedi students for about 800 years.[5] In the time before the invasion, Yoda took part in a council meeting. Several hours after that meeting, he took to mediating in a small garden in the temple, only to be interrupted by fellow council member Mace Windu, who, after Yoda waited for him to explain why he wanted a private discussion, expressed his belief that Yoda had sensed something he was keeping private. Yoda repeatedly responded that he sensed nothing: the issue was not that there was a problem to be sensed, but that something was being hidden. Not understanding but trusting the Grand Master's judgement, Windu excused himself while Yoda, incorrectly believing the dark side was far away, tried to find what it was that he could not sense. Yoda was unable to uncover the fact that the sensation was caused by the secret plots of the Sith Lord Darth Sidious.[64]\\nConcurrent to the Federation's occupation on Naboo, Yoda was present when Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn presented Anakin Skywalker, a young boy from the planet Tatooine, to the Council in the hopes of training him. Although Jinn believed Skywalker to be the Chosen One, prophesied to bring balance to the Force, Yoda and the other Council members did not share his opinion, sensing that the boy was harboring a high amount of fear and his future was uncertain. They therefore refused to allow for his training.[9]\\nAfter Jinn and his Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi returned to Naboo, they forged an alliance between the human inhabitants of the world and the native Gungan species in order to combat the Federation occupation forces. The Federation's droid army was eventually deactivated after Anakin Skywalker accidentally destroyed its command ship. During the battle, however, Jinn and Kenobi dueled a Sith apprentice[9]\\u2014Darth Maul, the Dathomirian Zabrak[68] apprentice of the Sidious\\u2014which cost Jinn his life.[9]\\n\\n     At Jinn's funeral, Yoda and Windu discussed the return of the Sith.  \\nWith the Naboo having waited until the Council's arrival to begin the funeral,[64] Yoda, along with other members of the Council, was present at the Naboo victory parade and Jinn's earlier funeral, where he shared his thoughts on the apparent reemergence of the Sith with fellow Master of the Order Mace Windu, pointing out[9] that the Rule of Two, the Sith succession system in effect at the time,[69] meant that another Sith was still present. Unbeknownst to the two Jedi, the remaining Sith was Sheev Palpatine, the Supreme Chancellor of the Galactic Republic, who had been sworn in after a Vote of No Confidence forced his predecessor Valorum to resign.[9]\\nYoda[9] and the other Council members remained at the funeral until Jinn's body turned to ash. Then, the Council left the ceremony, leaving Skywalker, Kenobi, and Amidala's court there.[64] With Jinn dead, following the events on Naboo, the Council named Jinn's former Padawan Obi-Wan Kenobi a Jedi Knight, who informed Yoda of his master's final will\\u2014that Skywalker be trained. Reluctantly, Yoda permitted him to take the boy as his Padawan. Yoda also attended the parade held by the Naboo and Gungans to celebrate their victory.[9]\\n\\nSeparatist Crisis\\n\\n\\\"I think it is time we inform the Senate that our ability to use the Force has diminished.\\\"\\\"Only the Dark Lord of the Sith knows of our weakness. If informed the Senate is, multiply, our adversaries will.\\\"\\n\\u2015Mace Windu and Yoda[14]\\n     Yoda on the eve of the Clone Wars.  \\nTen years after the Naboo crisis, several thousand systems[14] that were disillusioned with the Galactic Republic seceded from the government and formed the Confederacy of Independent Systems under the leadership of Count Dooku,[70] the former student of Yoda[14] who left the Order due to widespread corruption in the Republic.[71] As the Galactic Senate, the chief governing body of the Republic,[72] debated the creation of a standing army, an unsuccessful attempt was made on the life of Senator Amidala of Naboo. After Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Padawan Anakin Skywalker cornered the assassin, the killer was in turn killed by a mysterious person who escaped using his jetpack. The events prompted the Council, which included Yoda, to appoint Kenobi to track him down.[14]\\nKenobi's investigation led him to attempt to find the planet Kamino, whose location had been missing from the Jedi Archives. This discovery alarmed Yoda, who surmised that only a Jedi could have erased the files. Interrupting a training session with the Bear Clan, Yoda helped Kenobi pinpoint the world's exact location through meditation, allowing the latter to travel there. Following Kenobi's departure, Yoda experienced a vision while meditating, in which he heard the voice of the spirit of Qui-Gon Jinn, and sensed that Anakin Skywalker was in terrible pain. He discussed the vision with fellow Master Mace Windu afterwards.[14]\\n\\n     Yoda and Windu are informed by Kenobi.  \\nHaving arrived on Kamino, Kenobi reported that the Kaminoan cloners had created a clone army, the order for which had been placed by Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas,[14] who had perished around the time of the Invasion of Naboo.[73] Kenobi believed that the template used to create the army, bounty hunter Jango Fett, was the person involved in the attack on Amidala. After a brief encounter with Fett, Kenobi followed him to the planet Geonosis, where he found that Dooku's Separatists ordered the assassination attempt on Amidala and had constructed a droid army. After relaying the information to the Jedi Council, Kenobi was captured and scheduled for execution, later joined by Amidala and Anakin Skywalker.[14]\\n\\nThe Clone Wars\\nBattle of Geonosis\\n\\n\\\"The shroud of the dark side has fallen. Begun, the Clone War has.\\\"\\n\\u2015Master Yoda[14]\\nNews that Skywalker and Kenobi had been captured prompted the Council to dispatch a Jedi strike team to Geonosis, while Yoda headed to Kamino to take command of the clone forces. As a clone strike team interrupted the execution of Kenobi and his associates, the clones suffered casualties at the hands of the numerically superior Confederate battle droid forces. Yoda led the clones into battle, thus beginning a galaxywide conflict that would become known as the Clone Wars.[14]\\n\\n     Yoda duels his former apprentice Dooku on Geonosis.  \\nAs the clones engaged the Confederacy's forces in a massive battle, Yoda headed to rescue Kenobi and Skywalker from Dooku, who had incapacitated the duo in a duel. The diminutive Jedi Master showed his mastery and power over the Force surpassed that of Dooku by casually repelling the latter's telekinetic assault and Force lightning. He then engaged Dooku in a brief but intense duel, having the upper hand. Dooku, realizing he was outmatched by Yoda, used the Force to bring a large metal pillar down on the unconscious Skywalker and Kenobi, forcing Yoda to break off the duel and use his own powers to stop it from crushing them. Dooku used the distraction to flee aboard his personal craft. Although the battle on Geonosis ended in the Republic's favor, Yoda was concerned about the growing influence of the dark side of the Force and the outcome of the Clone Wars.[14]\\n\\nMentoring Anakin Skywalker\\nAs the Clone Wars progressed, Yoda decided to alleviate Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker's fear and inability to lose loved ones by assigning him a Padawan learner, Ahsoka Tano. He believed that by becoming a teacher, Skywalker would develop emotionally and that when the time came for Tano to go off on her own, he would understand that his excessive bonding to those he cared about was unnecessary.[5] Tano traveled to the planet of Christophsis, where she presented herself to Skywalker in the midst of a battle against Confederate forces.[74]\\nAfter the battle had concluded, Yoda, himself, arrived on the planet and assigned the duo to the task of finding Rotta,[74] the son of influential Hutt crime lord Jabba, who had been kidnapped as part of a plan arranged by his uncle Ziro to alienate the Hutts and the Jedi and drag the former into war.[75] After the two Jedi successfully completed the mission, Yoda, along with a group of clones, extracted them from the planet Tatooine.[74]\\n\\nAmbush on Rugosa\\n\\nVentress: \\\"If Yoda is indeed the Jedi warrior you believe he is, let him prove it.

Simultaneously, the Confederacy dispatched Asajj Ventress,[76] an assassin trained by Confederate leader Dooku,[78] to the moon with droid escort to pressure Katuunko into siding with the Separatists.[76]\\nYoda's starship was ambushed by two Confederate vessels upon arriving into the system, forcing him to use an escape pod to land on the surface of the moon, accompanied by three clone troopers. The Jedi then successfully made contact with the Toydarian delegation, prompting Ventress, who was at the king's location, to challenge Yoda: if he could defeat her droid units, Toydaria would join the Republic, but a defeat would result in the planet pledging its allegiance to the Confederacy. The Jedi accepted, and Katuunko requested that he be given a fair fight\\u2014an agreement which Ventress did not intend to honor.[76]\\n\\n     Yoda destroys a Confederate AAT.  \\nEncountering the droids, Yoda destroyed a squad of them by himself without using his lightsaber, and returned to assist his clone companions, until the arrival of droidekas forced them to flee. The Jedi covered their escape by deflecting the droids' blaster fire at a nearby rock formation that collapsed and crushed them, after which he and the clones retreated to a nearby cave to rest. In the cave, Yoda relaxed into his natural role as a teacher. Calling each clone by name, he raised their morale by lecturing them on their individuality in the Force.[76]\\nUpon hearing the sound of more approaching Confederate units, Yoda and his escort left the cave. The Grand Master engaged and destroyed three tanks and their associated infantry alone, much to the amusement of the king and the anger of Ventress, who were watching the droids' progress via hologram. Breaking the terms of the competition, the assassin sent in droidekas to take out Yoda, which the clones prevented by launching their final rocket that caused the enemy to be buried under a rock slide.[76]\\nKatuunko, impressed by Yoda, decided to join the Republic. As Yoda arrived to meet with the king, he used the Force to stop Ventress from killing Katuunko. When Ventress triggered an avalanche with planted explosives, Yoda saved Katuunko, Thire, Jek, and Rys from being crushed by rocks, maneuvering the debris to the side with the Force. Republic gunships soon arrived to retrieve the group.[76]\\nBack on the cruiser, Yoda entered a meditation in his cabin. He reached out with the Force to sense the clones he had served with, feeling their differences but sensing the same desires in each of them: to follow orders, win battles, and to be a good soldier. Yoda pondered on the humanity of the clones, deciding that the Republic must understand them as humans, nurturing them instead of treating them like machines. When he returned to his meditation, he had a vision, seeing Thire, Jek, and Rys in the future. Remembering how dangerous the visions of the future were, Yoda ended his meditation, but could not let go of the discomfort of the vision.[22]\\n\\nThe Malevolence crisis\\n     Yoda and Windu confer with Ahsoka Tano, who was adamant on rescuing Koon.  \\nAs the war progressed, the Confederacy developed the Malevolence, a heavy cruiser designed to incapacitate and destroy Republic vessels with its[79] mega-ion cannons,[80] which proceeded to destroy dozens of ships without leaving survivors.[79] The Jedi Council dispatched Jedi Master Plo Koon to track down the superweapon, but upon locating it, his fleet was ambushed and destroyed by the starship. Although Koon and some clones survived in an escape pod, Yoda, alongside fellow Jedi Mace Windu and Obi-Wan Kenobi, forbade Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano to search the system for survivors, citing the threat posed by the Malevolence. Skywalker and Tano, however, disregarded his warnings and successfully rescued Koon.[81] The Malevolence was later destroyed by a concerted Republic assault.[82]\\n\\nGunray's capture\\nSome time after the destruction of the Malevolence, Trade Federation Viceroy Nute Gunray was captured by the Republic on the planet of Rodia, but as he was being transported to Coruscant aboard the cruiser Tranquility by Jedi Master Luminara Unduli and Ahsoka Tano, a Separatist boarding party led by Asajj Ventress freed the prisoner. Unduli and Tano subsequently reported the loss of Gunray to Anakin Skywalker and Yoda.[83]\\n\\nThe Zillo Beast\\nIn the aftermath of the Battle of Malastare, Chancellor Palpatine ordered the Zillo Beast to be taken back to Coruscant for study.[84] However, the Zillo Beast escaped captivity and began to rampage through Coruscant. Yoda and Jedi General Aayla Secura moved to aid Skywalker, Kenobi, and Windu to recapture the beast. As gunships fired gas bombs in an attempt to pacify the beast, Yoda, Secura, and Skywalker used the Force to prevent themselves and their companions from inhaling the gas. The Zillo Beast was eventually killed by the gas bombs.[85]\\n\\nFacing the rising darkness\\nAttack on the Jedi Temple\\n     Ahsoka Tano speaks to the Jedi Council  \\nDuring the peak of the war, Barriss Offee with the help of Letta Turmond bombed the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. Yoda then ordered Anakin Skywalker and his Padawan Ahsoka Tano to return from Cato Neimoidia to help investigate, refusing to trust anyone who was in the temple during the bombing. Yoda's judgement was clouded, but he still guided the Jedi as the leader of the Council.[86]\\nTurmond was captured by Skywalker and Tano. In prison, she requested Tano speak with her, saying Tano was the only one she could trust. When Turmond was strangled to death by way of the Force, Wilhuff Tarkin, who was serving as an admiral in the Republic Army, had Tano arrested, accusing her of being the mastermind responsible for the attack. Desperate to prove her innocence, Tano escaped the prison, resulting in a manhunt led by Anakin Skywalker and Captain Rex. During the chase, Tano lost her Shoto lightsaber.[87]\\nAfter Tano fled to the Underworld, Yoda ordered Skywalker and Plo Koon to track her down and bring her to the Temple, with some resistance from Mace Windu, who felt that Skywalker's emotional connection to Tano would only make things worse. Tano was quickly captured by Asajj Ventress, who agreed to help the young Padawan in exchange for a pardon for Ventress' crimes as a Sith. Tano contacted Barriss Offee at the Jedi Temple. Offee led Tano into a trap by telling her she could find evidence to prove her innocence by going to a warehouse on Level 1315. There, Offee jumped Ventress, stealing her lightsabers and mask. She attacked Tano, knocking her out in front of crates of Nanodroids and effectively framing her for the bombing.[88]\\nTano was then brought back to the Temple, where Yoda and the rest of the Jedi Council reluctantly agreed to expel her from the Jedi Order and have her face a military tribunal before the Senate. Yoda, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Plo Koon and several other Council members were present in the court room, where Tano was prosecuted by Tarkin and defended by Padm\\u00e9 Amidala. However, before the jury could render its decision, Skywalker burst in with Barriss Offee, who confessed to being responsible for the bombings and the framing of Tano. In light of this revelation, Yoda, Skywalker and the Council personally invited Tano to rejoin the Order, but to their shock, she refused and left. Yoda would regret the Council's decision and began to question the doctrine of the war.[89]\\n\\nBiochip conspiracy\\n     Yoda speaks with the Council about Tup.  \\nSeveral years prior to the start of the war, Palpatine and his apprentice, Count Dooku secretly created the Clone Army with the assistance of an unsuspecting Sifo-Dyas, who had seen visions of a conflict beforehand. When this was done, they had organic inhibitor chips implanted in their brains, which would cause the clones to do anything Palpatine told them to, in this case execute the Jedi. With one simple command, the clones would enter a trance-like state and perform whatever orders they were given.[90]\\nDuring the Battle of Ringo Vinda, clone trooper Tup murdered Jedi Master Tiplar when his inhibitor chip was activated prematurely. Sidious ordered Dooku to apprehend Tup to prevent the Jedi from discovering the truth. Tup was eventually sent to Kamino after Anakin Skywalker, Captain Rex and ARC trooper Fives were able to recover Tup from a Separatist Transport.[91]\\nAfter escorting Tup to Kamino, Fives and Rex were greeted by Jedi Master Shaak Ti, alongside the main developer of the clones, Kaminoan scientist Nala Se. Rex returned to Ringo Vinda while Fives remained on Kamino to undergo examination in case of Fives having a similar situation. Disputes over the tests led to a debate. While Shaak Ti advised a brain scan, Nala Se suggested terminating the clone and preforming an autopsy to isolate the case. Shaak Ti contacted the Jedi Temple where Yoda, alongside Obi-Wan Kenobi, decided Tup should be brought to the temple to be examined through the Force.[90]\\nWhat the Jedi were unaware of was that the Kaminoans knew of the inhibitor chips and were working with Count Dooku, who used his Sith name, Tyranus, to prevent the Jedi from making the connection. Dooku ordered that Tup be terminated and that the chip be sent to him to be looked at.[90]\\nAngry at Nala Se and Master Ti for their treatment of Tup, Fives escaped the medical center and embarked on his own plan. Fives faked leaving the planet, but stayed to try and save Tup and discover the truth. He and the medical droid AZI-3 were able to preform a brain scan on Tup, where they learned of the inhibitor chips. Fives had the droid take the chip out of his and Tup's brains. Unfortunately, the already-weakened Tup died soon after the operation, whispering his last words to Fives.[90] Fives blamed Nala Se for what happened to Tup. Suspecting the Kaminoans of treachery, and with the support of Master Ti, Fives insisted on presenting his evidence and the removed chips directly to Palpatine. Fives was eventually brought to Coruscant, at the request of Shaak Ti, where he was brought before the Chancellor. As the ship landed, Nala Se drugged Fives, causing him to act strange.[92]\\nWhen Fives attempted to assassinate Palpatine, Yoda was a part of the Jedi Council that ordered Anakin Skywalker to investigate. Fives was killed in the end, and Yoda was ultimately told that the doctors had found another cause, and that a vaccination had been prepared in case of a future incident.[93]\\n\\nThe mystery of Sifo-Dyas\\n\\n\\\"Know now we do that guide the creation of the clones from the beginning, Dooku did. Hm, our enemy created an army for us.\\\"  \\\"If this was known, public confidence in the war effort, the Jedi, and the Republic would vanish. There would be mass chaos.\\\"  \\\"Cover up this discovery we must. No one, not even the Chancellor, may know. Valiant men the clones have proven to be. Saved my life and yours they have many times. Believe in them we must. Win the war swiftly we must, before our enemy's designs reach completion, whatever they may be.\\\"\\n\\u2015Yoda and Mace Windu[73]\\nSometime later, the Jedi received a distress signal from a moon near Oba Diah. Sending Plo Koon and Commander Wolfe to investigate, they found the remains of a shuttle and the lightsaber of Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas, who was killed sometime around the Battle of Naboo while dealing with a conflict on Felucia. Upon reviewing the temple archives, Jocasta Nu and the Jedi found that the information had been sealed by order of the Supreme Chancellor. While sending Anakin Skywalker and his master, Obi-Wan Kenobi to Felucia, Yoda went to speak with Palpatine, not knowing he was the Sith Lord that orchestrated the murder and the creation of the clone army. Palpatine told Yoda to visit Chancellor Valorum, as these events had happened before the vote of no confidence that led to Palpatine becoming chancellor. Palpatine then contacted Count Dooku, telling him to destroy the last piece of the puzzle before the Jedi would be able to unravel the mystery.[73]\\n\\n     Yoda meets with former Supreme Chancellor Finis Valorum on Coruscant.  \\nAnakin and Obi-Wan attempted to communicate with the native tribe on the Felucia, but were unable to understand them. They did learn, however, that a second Jedi had shown up with Sifo-Dyas.[73]\\nValorum told Yoda that he had sent Sifo-Dyas to negotiate with the Pyke Syndicate to stop a booming drug trade underneath Coruscant. Valorum also revealed that he kept this secret, fearing his opponents in the bureaucracy. The talks were postponed after the Council sent Sifo-Dyas to intervene on Felucia. Valorum was unable to identify the second Jedi, but did say that his assistant, Silman, was with Sifo-Dyas when he was shot down.[73]\\nEventually, Yoda dispatched Anakin and Obi-Wan to Oba Diah, where they learned the Pykes were paid to shoot down the ship carrying Sifo-Dyas, but had kept Silman captive as leverage and that Dooku was in fact the individual known as Tyranus, leading them to realize Dooku impersonated Sifo-Dyas to help push forward the Clone Wars. Yoda, not knowing how to stop the plot, suggested the Jedi keep the discovery a secret, and that they should keep playing the Sith Lord's game.[73]\\n\\nDiscovering immortality\\n\\n\\\"It is I, Qui-Gon Jinn.\\\"\\\"That cannot be. Dead, you are.\\\"\\\"No. I am part of the Living Force, Yoda.\\\"\\n\\u2015Qui-Gon Jinn communes to Yoda[94]\\n     Yoda hears the voice of Qui-Gon Jinn.  \\nWhile meditating during the end of the war, Yoda heard the voice of Qui-Gon Jinn, who demonstrated his presence by levitating Yoda. The encounter left Yoda distracted during the subsequent Council gathering, leaving them worried about whether the stresses of the war were finally taking its toll on him. While strolling through the Temple gardens, Yoda was greeted by Anakin. Yoda asked him about his encounter with Qui-Gon's spirit on Mortis, which Anakin had dismissed as a trick, noting the Jedi belief that one could not retain their identity after becoming one with the Force. Yoda responded that he now questioned this dogma.[94]\\nYoda confessed what happened to the Council, much to their disbelief. They agreed though to meditate with him, to verify his experience. Despite meditating together for an entire day, they were unable to hear anything. Ki-Adi-Mundi expressed worry that Yoda had become susceptible to Sith manipulation, so Yoda underwent medical tests that revealed that he was still in good health. Jedi Doctor Rig Nema suggested Yoda undergo a deprivation ritual that would allow him to meditate more strongly and find the source of the voice.[94]\\nAgreeing, Yoda was suspended in a liquid tank with an oxygen mask to bring him as close as possible to death without actually becoming one with the Force. While unconscious, Qui-Gon's voice requested Yoda go to Dagobah, and to tell no one about it. After, Obi-Wan broke open the tank due to his concern over Yoda's failing life signs.[94]\\nPut on bedrest and under guard, Yoda convinced Anakin to help him escape by posing as simply accompanying each other for a walk. Guided to the Jedi Temple Hangar, Anakin lent Yoda his astromech droid, R2-D2 to accompany him to his personal interceptor. Yoda and R2-D2 flew to Dagobah, where Yoda asked the droid to stay with their ship while he found a clearing to meditate.[94]\\n\\n     Yoda communes with Qui-Gon on Dagobah.  \\nQui-Gon's voice greeted him. Yoda asked why he could not see him. Qui-Gon explained he had not been fully trained enough to do so. The Living Force appeared to Yoda in the form of fireflies, guiding Yoda to a cave strong with the dark side, it showed the Jedi Master a vision of the future, where a hooded Sith Lord slaughtered the Jedi. Qui-Gon explained to a distraught Yoda that he would help him bring hope for the future, and directed him to the planet that spawned the midi-chlorians.[94][59]\\n\\n     Yoda confronts his own dark side.  Arriving there, Yoda gave his lightsaber to R2-D2 for safekeeping, and descended into the world to meet the Force Priestesses, who agreed to teach him how to achieve life after death. First, Yoda confronted a manifestation of his own dark side, conquering his hubris. Next, he witnessed a vision of the Jedi massacred in the Temple, where an apparition of a dying Ahsoka Tano asked him if she would still become one with the Force after being expelled from the Jedi Order; this vision was a manifestation of Yoda's guilt over having placed Tano on the path that led to her departure. An apparition of Katooni then invited Yoda to enter a peaceful courtyard to escape these painful events. Seeing Qui-Gon Jinn, Kenobi, Tano, and Dooku together, alive and full Jedi, Yoda eventually recognized the vision's falsehood, overcoming its temptation and his attachment to those that have fallen.[59]\\nInstructed to complete his tests on the Sith homeworld of Moraband, Yoda and R2-D2 flew to the valley where the ancient Sith Lords were buried. Recognizing the danger, Yoda instructed R2-D2 to return to the Jedi Temple and inform the Council of what happened, if he did not come back after three nights. Specters of a serpent, undead Sith warriors, and even Darth Bane himself confronted him, but Yoda brushed them off. As he entered a temple execution chamber, the Force Priestesses warned Yoda that whatever he encountered there would be beyond their control.[95]\\nUnknown to Yoda, Darth Sidious and Dooku sensed his presence on Moraband, and met in an abandoned tower in the industrial sector of Coruscant. Using Dooku and Yoda's Force-bond, Sidious planned to reach out to Yoda and crush his spirit. Appearing in a vision to Yoda in the form of Sifo-Dyas, Sidious temped Yoda, until the Grandmaster rejected him. The Dark Lord then had Yoda wake up in a Republic attack gunship with Anakin and members of the 501st Legion, en route to terminate the Sith on Coruscant. As they arrived, the clones, led by Captain Rex, rushed at Dooku only to be killed with Sith lightning. Skywalker immediately attacked Dooku while Sidious fled. Walking sadly past the fallen clones, a dismayed Yoda witnessed Skywalker defeat Dooku and brutally decapitate him. However, he left Skywalker and pursued Sidious.[95]\\nEmerging out on a catwalk, Yoda and Sidious dueled. Skywalker tried to help, but Sidious knocked him out. Sensing an opportunity, Sidious damaged the catwalk, forcing Yoda to divide his attention between Force-lifting Skywalker to save him from falling to his death and blocking Sidious' Sith lightning. After Sidious taunted him by suggesting he sacrifice Skywalker to concentrate on defeating him, Yoda put down his lightsaber to ensure Skywalker's safety. As the catwalk collapsed, Yoda maneuvered Skywalker to safety, then Force-threw his saber to ensure the Sith would fall and grabbed Sidious, dragging him down too. Yoda tore Sidious's hood off, seeking his identify, but in the vision world only seeing a shadow, then an empty robe, before both fell to their \\\"doom.\\\" The incident proved Yoda's selflessness and demonstrated his resolve to Sidious, who concluded the illusion as he realized it would take more to defeat or taint the Jedi Master.[95]\\nYoda awoke and was greeted by a Priestess who explained he would continue his training with Qui-Gon's spirit. As she disappeared in a glow of light, Yoda had a vision of the future, including his own death.[96] Yoda returned to the Jedi Temple, where Windu and Kenobi greeted him in the garden. Yoda claimed his journey had been uneventful, but wondered how long the Jedi could resist the dark side during the war.[95]\\n\\nUtapau crystal crisis\\nFollowing the death of Master Tu-Anh on the sinkhole world of Utapau, Yoda and his fellow Jedi Council members sent Master Kenobi and Anakin on a mission to investigate her death.[97] They discovered that she had been investigating Separatist efforts to excavate and obtain a giant kyber crystal on Utapau. After destroying the crystal and thus denying the Separatists access to the weapon, Yoda was present at a Council meeting when the two Jedi gave a report of the events on Utapau. During the meeting, Yoda recounted how the ancient Sith had constructed superweapons using massive kyber crystals to power them up. He feared that Dooku's mysterious master Darth Sidious had similar intentions.[98]\\n\\nThe plan to assassinate Count Dooku\\n\\n\\\"One, there is, who has tried and failed. Yet closer has she come than any other to killing Count Dooku.\\\"\\\"You can't possibly mean Ventress!\\\"\\n\\u2015Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi[8]\\n     The Jedi Council partnered Master Quinlan Vos with Asajj Ventress to kill Dooku.  \\nYoda and his fellow Jedi Council members witnessed Count Dooku's devastating attack on Mahranee, the home world of the Mahran species, via hologram. The Council was reluctant to condone an assassination, but ultimately concluded that killing Dooku was necessary to end the war and prevent more deaths. The Council decided to use Master Quinlan Vos, who had considerable experience with undercover work, to assassinate the Separatist leader. When Vos suggested that a partner accompany him, Yoda recommended Asajj Ventress, Dooku's former Sith apprentice and a Nightsister for that mission, knowing her hatred for Dooku. Ventress agreed to assist Vos with his mission but insisted that he had to learn the ways of the dark side.[8]\\nDespite their preparation, Vos and Ventress were bested by Dooku and Grievous, who took Vos captive. Dooku then managed to bring Vos over to the dark side by revealing that Ventress had murdered his late Master, Tholme. After Vos spurned Ventress' offer to rescue him, he became Dooku's newest Sith apprentice and assumed the persona of \\\"Admiral Enigma.\\\" Ventress informed Master Kenobi who conveyed the news to his fellow Council members including Yoda. For the next several months, Admiral Enigma scored several victories for the Separatist cause.[8]\\nWhen Vos' old friend Akar-Deshu, a Mahran Jedi, brought Ventress into a Council meeting to discuss rescuing Vos, Yoda and Kenobi spoke up for Ventress when Windu wanted to arrest her. During the proceedings, Yoda and his fellow Jedi learned that Ventress had instructed Vos in the dark side in order to defeat Dooku. While Windu was suspicious of Ventress, Yoda and Kenobi were convinced that she genuinely cared for Vos and that she had rejected the Sith ways for good. After sending Ventress along with Desh and Anakin outside, Yoda and his fellow Jedi debated whether to include Ventress in their rescue mission. When Master Kenobi suggested leading the operation to rescue Vos, Yoda accepted Kenobi's offer and also argued that Ventress was key to the rescue mission. He also recommended that Kenobi take both Ventress and his former Padawan Skywalker along for the mission.[8]\\nAfter receiving intelligence from Admiral Wullf Yularen that Count Dooku and \\\"Admiral Enigma\\\" were planning to attack Taris, the Jedi Council decided that they had to move quickly to rescue Quinlan. In the end, the Council decided to offer Ventress a pardon for all her crimes in return for rescuing Vos. The rescue mission was a success and the Jedi succeeded in recovering Vos alive. To reward her services, Ventress was formally pardoned. Unknown to Yoda and his colleagues, Vos had become a Separatist double agent in order to gain Dooku's trust so that he could learn the identity of Darth Sidious and destroy the Sith once and for all.[8]\\nUsing his position in the Jedi Order, Vos leaked intelligence about Jedi and Republic military operations to Count Dooku; allowing the Separatists to undermine these operations. After several Council members voiced their suspicions about Vos' true loyalties, Yoda had a personal meeting with Vos and was able to deduce that Quinlan had fallen to the dark side. To test Vos' loyalties, the Jedi Council sent him to assassinate Dooku, but secretly sent Kenobi and Skywalker to tail him.[8]\\nVos managed to defeat Dooku in lightsaber combat, but did not kill him. When Vos demanded that Dooku lead him to Darth Sidious, Kenobi and Skywalker promptly revealed themselves and arrested the two men. After learning of Vos and Dooku's arrest, Master Yoda ordered Kenobi to bring them back to the Jedi Temple where they would be interrogated and executed for their crimes. However, Vos and Dooku escaped with the unwitting help of Ventress, leading to the events of the second battle of Christophsis. In the end, Ventress helped Vos return to the light side, but was[8] seemingly[99] killed by Dooku. Kenobi and Skywalker then recaptured Vos and brought him back to Coruscant.[8]\\nAfter Vos confessed all his crimes and explained his motivations to destroy the Sith, Yoda and his fellow Council members accepted Vos' repentance as genuine and pardoned him. Kenobi, who believed that the order to assassinate Dooku was morally wrong and responsible for Vos' fall to the dark side, took on the responsibility of monitoring Vos during his rehabilitation. Kenobi accompanied Vos to Dathomir for Ventress' funeral.[8]\\n\\nLast days of the Clone Wars\\n\\n\\\"I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi. The Dark Side of the Force surrounds the Chancellor. [...] The Jedi Council will have to take control of the Senate to ensure a peaceful transition.\\\"\\\"To a dark place this line of thought will take us. Great care we must take.\\\"\\n\\u2015Windu and Yoda[10]\\n     Yoda counsels Anakin about his visions.  \\nThree years after the initial battle on Geonosis, the Republic was crumbling under the attacks of the Confederacy. Throughout the course of the war, Palpatine had been granted ever increasing personal authority by the Senate to command both the war and the Republic at large. The Jedi Council, though reluctant to oppose the extremely popular Chancellor, nonetheless grew ever more concerned about the continual centralization of political power in Palpatine. A Separatist attack on the Republic capital world of Coruscant was launched by General Grievous as well,[10] with Yoda taking part in the defense of Coruscant. Yoda used the Force to make enemy craft collide with each other.[100]\\nShortly after the battle, Skywalker came before Yoda, seeking counsel. He had been experiencing terrifying visions of the death of a loved one, though he did not reveal that the one in question was his secret wife, Padm\\u00e9 Amidala. Yoda warned Skywalker to be wary of his visions and of his own feelings, as fear was a path to the dark side, and advised him to \\\"train himself to let go of everything he feared to lose.\\\" Skywalker, however, was dissatisfied with this answer, as he could not bear the thought of losing someone he loved. Shortly afterwards, Palpatine, hoping to increase his influence over the Jedi Council and further ingratiate himself with Anakin Skywalker, appointed the young Jedi to be his personal representative on the Council. The Council, having little choice, begrudgingly accepted Palpatine's interference, but refused to grant Skywalker the rank of Jedi Master, infuriating him. Additionally, the Council gave Skywalker the unofficial assignment of spying on Palpatine, an assignment which Skywalker was less than enthusiastic about, as he regarded Palpatine as a friend and a mentor.[10]\\n\\n     Yoda and the Jedi Council discuss the Kashyyyk invasion.  \\nFollowing Skywalker's appointment, the Council chose to take action to avert an imminent Separatist invasion of Kashyyyk. Yoda chose to personally oversee the defense, as he was held in high esteem by the Wookiees. Before leaving for the planet, Yoda discussed with Obi-Wan and Windu about Anakin's assignment. Kenobi expressed his former Padawan's disagreement, and asked if he was not going to fulfill the prophecy when Windu doubted his abilities. Yoda suggested that it could've been misread, but Obi-Wan believed they would not be let down, which Yoda hoped would be true.[10]\\n\\n     Yoda observing the Battle of Kashyyyk.  \\nOn Kashyyyk, Yoda participated in a holographic session of the Council, where he learned from Skywalker that Republic intelligence located the fugitive General Grievous in the Utapau system. When Anakin volunteered to lead the campaign, with the stated approval of Palpatine, Yoda and Mace both disagreed, and Yoda nominated Kenobi to be sent instead. Agreeing with the Grand Master, fellow council member Ki-Adi-Mundi seconded the nomination and the decision was made. Yoda left the call and was approached by Commander Gree, who told him that the droids had started their power generators. Yoda ordered his troops to prepare, and soon after the battle began. He observed the battle from above when a shot almost hit him.[10]\\nLater, on a meeting in the Temple's war room with Windu, Anakin, Mundi, and Aayla Secura, they were interrupted by Commander Cody, who informed that General Kenobi had engaged Grievous and that the battle had begun on Utapau. Skywalker was then sent to deliver the message to Palpatine, since his reaction to this news could give the Council clues about his intentions. After Anakin left,[10] Mace informed the other Jedi that he felt a plot to destroy the Order, and that the Chancellor was surrounded by the dark side. Mundi and Windu suggested to take control over the Senate in case Palpatine did not abide of his emergency powers, though Yoda expressed that this would lead them to a \\\"dark path\\\", and that they would need to be careful.[10][101]\\nRight afterwards, Ahsoka Tano and Commander Rex joined the call. She revealed that they successfully captured Maul on Mandalore and that he would be delivered to Coruscant by them, which Yoda considered a great service. Ahsoka stated she did her duty as a citizen, but when Yoda asked if it was not as a Jedi, she simply said that \\\"not yet\\\". Tano wanted to speak with Skywalker, but since he had left, Windu and Yoda explained Obi-Wan's situation to her. When she realized the war could end soon, Windu retorted that it would depend on Palpatine, but refused to explain more to her, which did not sit well with Yoda. As the members of the call left, Yoda stayed and asked Ahsoka if she had anything else to say, and after a brief silence, she confirmed she would tell the information to Anakin himself. Yoda then said \\\"May the Force be with you, Padawan.\\\" and ended his transmission.[101]\\nAs the battle on Kashyyyk continued, Supreme Chancellor Palpatine revealed his true identity as the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, killed a group of Jedi Council members who had come to arrest him, and with his offers of dark knowledge, turned Anakin Skywalker to the dark side of the Force. When Sidious bestowed the name of Darth Vader to Skywalker, Yoda felt the moment through the Force.[10]\\n\\nOrder 66\\n\\n\\\"How many other Jedi have managed to survive?\\\"\\\"Heard from no one have we.\\\"\\n\\u2015Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda, after Order 66[10]\\nChristening his newfound apprentice Darth Vader, Sidious sent him and part of the 501st Legion to attack the Jedi Temple and slaughter all who resided there. Meanwhile, Sidious began to broadcast Order 66 to the clone troopers, a contingency order that required them to eliminate their Jedi Generals, which the clone complied to due to the activation of their biochips.[10]\\n\\n     Yoda survives the attempt on his life.  \\nAs the clone army betrayed and turned on their leaders galaxy-wide, Yoda sensed the deaths of his fellow Jedi and fell to his knees. Commander Gree and Captain Jek received Order 66 a few moments afterwards and prepared to shoot Yoda. However, Yoda sensed their intentions and decapitated the duo with his lightsaber. He then proceeded to escape with the help of the Wookiees Chewbacca and Tarfful, rendezvousing with Senator Bail Organa of Alderaan and Obi-Wan Kenobi, who had escaped death on Utapau.[10]\\n\\n     Yoda fights the 501st troopers guarding the Jedi Temple.  \\nThe two Jedi discussed their situation, during which Bail and Yoda informed Kenobi that the Temple was broadcasting a coded retreat message, ordering all surviving Jedi to return to Coruscant. Yoda and Kenobi decided to return to the Temple and reconfigure the beacon to warn any survivors to go into hiding, and to that end Bail took them to Coruscant. The two Jedi fought their way in and witnessed the effects of the rampage by Vader and his clone unit, including the visible lightsaber cuts on several dead Jedi. In the meantime, Sidious, as Palpatine, reforms the Republic into the first Galactic Empire with himself as its Emperor. That was the beginning of the Age of the Empire.[10]\\n\\nThe Age of the Empire\\nDuel in the Senate\\n\\n\\\"I have waited a long time for this moment, my little green friend\\u2026 at last, the Jedi are no more.\\\"\\\"Not if anything to say about it, I have! [\\u2026] At an end your rule is, and not short enough it was.\\\"\\n\\u2015Darth Sidious and Yoda[10]\\nHaving recalibrated the signal, Kenobi wished to learn the identity of the one responsible for the massacre. Yoda, aware that watching recordings of their fellow Jedi being slaughtered would cause Kenobi pain, cautioned him before the younger Jedi activated the security recordings. The duo thus learned of Anakin Skywalker's fall to the dark side, his Sith title of Darth Vader, Palpatine's Sith identity and the formation of the Galactic Empire from the Republic. Agreeing that the two Sith had to be destroyed, Yoda headed to the Galactic Senate to confront the Emperor, while a deeply reluctant Kenobi departed to the volcanic planet of Mustafar to face his former apprentice.[10]\\n\\n     Yoda battling Darth Sidious in the Senate chamber.  \\nUpon arriving into the Chancellery Secretariat, Yoda confronted the Emperor, who surprised the Jedi and rendered him briefly unconscious with a burst of Force lightning. As Sidious boasted how he came to eradicate the Jedi Order, Yoda managed to wake up and slammed his opponent into a wall. Sidious attempted to depart, but was barred by Yoda. The duo then drew their lightsabers and engaged in a fierce duel that soon continued into the central auditorium of the Senate Building, driving the Sith back to his speaking pod. Briefly separated from Yoda, Sidious launched the numerous Senate hoverpods at his opponent, but the Jedi nevertheless managed to catch up with him, engaging him at close quarters again with his lightsaber drawn. Sidious then blasted Yoda with a burst of Force lightning which tore Yoda's lightsaber from his hand, but which the Jedi proceeded to successfully deflect with his bare palms. Yoda slowly redirected Sidious's force lighting at him, appearing to give the Jedi Master the upper hand. However, the buildup of energy subsequently triggered an explosion that blew both combatants apart and caused Yoda to fall to the bottom of the chamber, while Sidious was thrown out of the pod but managed to barely hold on to one of its guardrails, gaining the high ground. Despite neither conquering the other, Yoda realized he had been defeated, which prompted the Jedi Master to flee through the maintenance tunnels of the building. He then contacted Organa to rescue him via his airspeeder, considering the duel his personal failure and voicing his intent to go into self-imposed exile.[10]\\n\\nExile\\n\\n\\\"Into exile I must go. Failed, I have.\\\"\\n\\u2015Yoda, to Bail Organa[10]\\nAfter being rescued by Organa, the two proceeded to the asteroid Polis Massa, where Yoda conferred with Qui-Gon Jinn's spirit, who offered him to train him in techniques that could help him retain his identity after his death. Obi-Wan Kenobi, having defeated but not killed Vader on Mustafar, arrived soon thereafter, bringing with him the dying Senator Amidala. She gave birth to her twins from Anakin Skywalker and named them Luke and Leia before her death.[10]\\nSensing the children's power in the Force, Yoda, Kenobi and Organa decided to keep them hidden in unsuspecting locations to avoid detection by the Empire; Luke Skywalker was delivered to the Lars family on Tatooine, while Organa personally adopted his sister, Leia. As the trio prepared to go their separate ways, Yoda asked Kenobi for a moment of his time. He revealed that he had training for him during his solitude on Tatooine, and that Qui-Gon Jinn had reached the path to immortality, having returned from the Netherworld of the Force. Yoda decided he would teach Kenobi to communicate with Jinn.[10]\\n\\n     Yoda lands on the planet Dagobah, his home for the rest of his life.  \\nUsing an E3-standard starship lifeboat, Yoda returned to Dagobah to begin his own exile where he waited for the twins to grow up and continued his studies of the Force. The lifeboat served as Yoda's initial shelter but it started to degrade within a year due to Dagobah's swampy environment. As the first shelter was slowly consumed by the swamp, Yoda built a new home for himself.[102] He positioned it near to the dark side cave but out of range of its influence and would visit every few years.[103] However, the Dagobah wet season created a need for the Jedi Master to regularly relocate to the planet's highlands for the duration.[104] Following the destruction of the Jedi Order, Yoda was listed as one of the Inquisitorius' priority targets amongst presumed survivors of the Great Jedi Purge.[105]\\nAround a year after Order 66, Tano was hiding on the world of Thabeska, where she had met a Force-sensitive child named Hedala Fardi. Despite her young age, the child proved to be wise, and Tano was upset that Fardi would likely never be able to prove her wisdom to Yoda. Later, while sleeping aboard the CR90 corvette Tantive IV after Organa offered her a chance to join his rebellion, Tano remembered Yoda's advice to her when she was getting her first kyber crystal. Awaking and knowing she should make a new set of lightsabers, she thanked Yoda, even though she knew he could not possibly hear or help her.[67]\\n\\nHelping the Spectres\\n\\n\\\"Master Yoda, you're powerful. You must know a way to destroy Vader and his Inqusitors.\\\"\\\"Padawan, thousands of Jedi once there were. Then came war. In our arrogance, join the conflict swiftly we did. Fear, anger, hate.

Consumed by fear, I was, though see it I did not.\\\"\\\"You were afraid?\\\"\\\"Yes, afraid. Hmm, surprised are you? A challenge lifelong it is, not to bend fear into anger.\\\"\\n\\u2015Ezra Bridger consults Yoda through the Force[106]\\n     Yoda appearing to Ahsoka Tano and biding her farewell.  \\nDuring his exile on Dagobah, Yoda kept an eye on other Jedi throughout the galaxy, including those who ventured into the various Jedi Temples found amongst the stars. Approximately four years before the Battle of Yavin, Yoda spoke to Kanan Jarrus, who had been the Padawan of Depa Billaba and a survivor of Order 66.[107][108] Jarrus had traveled to the Jedi Temple on the planet Lothal with his own Padawan, Ezra Bridger, to whom Yoda also spoke. Bridger was in the temple in order to overcome his greatest fears; Yoda acted as an anonymous guide in helping Bridger do so and to understand why he wanted to become a Jedi and how to withdraw from the anger and the wish of revenge within him. This guidance led Bridger to receive a kyber crystal, which he used to build his own lightsaber. Meanwhile, Yoda counseled Jarrus about Jarrus' insecurities as a teacher.[109]\\nThe year after, Jarrus and Bridger returned to the Lothal Temple with Ahsoka Tano in search of a way to defeat the Inquisitorius. Yoda cast an illusion of the Jedi Temple Guard for Jarrus, including the Grand Inquisitor as he was before the Jedi Purge. The Inquisitor forced Jarrus to recognize his fears and knighted him a true Jedi. Meanwhile, Bridger pleaded with Yoda for help:[106] though still filled with fear and shame and thus disinterested in fighting the Empire before training a new Skywalker,[110][104] the Jedi Master ultimately rendered aid and directed him to go to Malachor. When the other Inquisitors arrived, Yoda used the Temple Guard to distract them as the Jedi escaped. As she fled, Tano turned back and saw Yoda, who smiled and waved at her: she smiled back being the last time they saw each other.[106][111]\\n\\nThe last Jedi\\nDuring the events that led up to the Battle of Yavin, Yoda noticed that with the Dagobah rains ended it was time to migrate back to his lowland hut, and was grateful as his usual accommodation for the wet season reminded him too much of the Jedi Temple and his failings. He reflected on how age had affected him and realized that he had become truly reliant on the walking stick he had originally adopted as an affectation for a joke played on his padawans. The Jedi packed what little he owned and left but not before he checked for the Imperial probe droids which had once searched for him endlessly.[104]\\n\\n     Yoda during his exile on Dagobah  \\nAs Yoda descended farther downhill, however, he felt a presence. It was neither a probe droid nor one of the Empire's ships but vibrations in the Force from Obi-Wan Kenobi and what remained of Anakin Skywalker. A probe droid then appeared and Yoda quickly took out a pot given to him by Kenobi. He used the Force to smash it into the droid only to suddenly sense Kenobi's death at the hands of Darth Vader. With the Jedi distracted, two more droids arrived but Yoda crushed them both and continued on home.[104]\\nAs ever, the hut had survived its hibernation but was dripping and spongy. Five days later, Yoda had dried and cleaned the house. Each time he saw the shelf usually reserved for his pot, he reacted with some loneliness after destroying Obi-Wan's gift to him. Feeling his isolation, he reached out to the netherworld of the Force to speak to Qui-Gon Jinn, but the spirit of Obi-Wan answered instead and requested that Skywalker's child be trained. Having harbored regrets about not having taken the man's daughter as his apprentice, and assuaged that he had enough time left to teach another pupil, the Jedi Master readily agreed until he found out that Kenobi was actually speaking of Anakin's unfocused son instead. Nevertheless, Yoda begrudgingly allowed Kenobi to direct the boy to him.[104] As Yoda ruminated on his decision afterwards, he returned to the \\\"Cave of Evil\\\" and was reassured that the site had no new fears to show him.[103]\\n\\nA phantom visitor\\n\\n\\\"Yoda had to know all of that. He could have killed me or let the planet do it for him. Instead\\u2026he chose to teach me.\\\"\\n\\u2015The Archivist[112]\\nSometime later, a mysterious woman once known as Madelin Sun who became known as \\\"The Archivist\\\" arrived on Dagobah in search of Yoda at the behest of Lady Qi'ra, the leader of the crime syndicate Crimson Dawn, who wanted Yoda's help to take down the Sith. When the Archivist was attacked by a monster after arriving on the planet, Yoda used the Force to save her from a distance and then led her into the dark side cave in order to dissuade her from looking for him. Having a change of heart, she left the planet as Yoda watched from afar. The Archivist returned to Qi'ra, lying and telling her that Yoda was dead.[112]\\n\\nHaunted by Kenobi\\n\\n\\\"The shadow that has fallen across the galaxy\\u2026my fault, it is. I have exiled myself here, not just for penance. I have removed myself from events\\u2026because without me, better off the galaxy is.\\\"\\n\\u2015Yoda to the spirit of Kenobi[113]\\nThree years after agreeing to train Skywalker,[114] Kenobi contacted Yoda, who at first ignored the late Jedi Master's spirit. Kenobi urged Yoda to see reason and acknowledge the growing darkness in the galaxy. Yoda mused that the threat had become too powerful\\u2014too big\\u2014for him to defeat, to which Kenobi reminded Yoda of the first lesson the latter would teach new Jedi: \\\"size matters not.\\\" Yoda admitted that he had sensed Kenobi's demise and had been avoiding him on purpose, once again expressing a defeatist attitude to the situation at hand. Kenobi dismissed the notion, not believing it himself and saying he did not think Yoda believed it either. Yoda reflected on his own inability to stop Darth Sidious and the fall of Anakin Skywalker, stating the galaxy was better off without him.[113]\\nYoda later had a dream in which Bree Menaren, Yoda's old pupil, taught and encouraged him to play the taratti. Yoda, sensing something was amiss, turned to see the sky blocked out by a massive battle station. The Jedi Master drew his lightsaber to find himself facing an apparation of Anakin Skywalker as a Padawan, his eyes glowing yellow, also encouraging Yoda to play with the toy. Activating his weapon, Yoda was confronted with a twisted vision of an undead Qui-Gon Jinn, who berated Yoda for his ignorance before engaging him in a brief lightsaber duel. Yoda began to deny his claims, only to be annihilated by a blinding green light crashing down from the superweapon above.[115]\\nYoda woke from the nightmare to find Kenobi at his side. When Yoda questioned the spirit's continued presence, Kenobi stated that he would remain until Yoda agreed to hear him out and do as he asked. The elder Jedi master, looking to get away from Kenobi, set out from his hut to find herbs for his soup. Kenobi followed, reminiscing about times past and reminding Yoda about his making pastries when Kenobi was but a youngling. Not finding any herbs, Yoda remarked he had made a wrong turn only to realize that he and Kenobi had arrived at the Cave of Evil\\u2014exactly where Yoda needed to be, Kenobi opined, \\\"from a certain point of view.\\\"[115]\\n\\nEntering the Cave of Evil\\n\\n\\\"But what of you, old friend? Will you be ready when he comes?\\\"\\\"Ready to teach? Yes, I will. Ready to teach\\u2014and ready to learn.\\\"\\n\\u2015The spirit of Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda, after the latter went in the Cave of Evil[115]\\nYoda refused to go inside, believing that was what Kenobi wanted of him, to which Kenobi merely asked Yoda if he thought that would be the right course of action. Yoda noted that the location was stong in the dark side and had nothing to prove, with Kenobi reasoning that his fellow master should therefore have nothing to fear. Yoda dismissed the venture as a foolish waste of time but relented nonetheless.[115]\\nEntering the vergence, Yoda was startled by a creature of Dagobah's wildlife, the Jedi Master grumbling that he had become old and foolish. Yoda was then confronted by a voice from the shadows\\u2014an apparation of Dooku, his former apprentice. The illusion blamed Yoda for his fall to the Dark Side, revealing his hand in the death of Yaddle and beginning to duel Yoda. Yoda then experienced a vision of High Republic Era Jedi Keeve Trennis, who refused to help Yoda and, like Dooku, blamed him for her final fate.[115]\\n\\n     Yoda has a vision of Keeve Trennis in the Cave of Evil while fighting an apparition of Dooku.  \\nTrennis used the Force to push Yoda into a mound of skulls, which a burning Anakin Skywalker claimed to be the Jedi Master's failures\\u2014those who had died. Bail Organa, Padm\\u00e9 Amidala, and Mace Windu emerged from the grave, reminding Yoda that they had looked to him for answers. Yoda replied that he could not have known how things would ultimately turn out, only for a spectre of Darth Sidious to cite the Jedi Master as the greatest of his apprentices, blind and unaware. Sidious noted there way no way back because of him, to which Yoda began repeating the phrase and drowning in the pile of corpses.[115]\\nIt was then that Bree appeared, reminding the Jedi Master that there was no situation was entirely without hope\\u2014something he had learned from Yoda himself. Bree elaborated that one could make as many mistakes as was required because, as Yoda finished the thought for him, \\\"the greatest teacher, failure is.\\\" Yoda remembered the lessons of the Jedi and struck down the remaining ghosts of his past.[115]\\nExiting the cave, Yoda found Kenobi waiting for him. Yoda answered an affirmative to the question on Kenobi's mind, agreeing to train the son of Anakin Skywalker. Removing Bree's taratti from his robe, Yoda stated that he was ready to teach but also ready to learn.[115]\\n\\nTaking a new apprentice\\n\\n\\\"Do, or do not. There is no try.\\\"\\n\\u2015Yoda to Luke Skywalker\\u00a0\\u2014  Listen (file info)[7]\\nSoon thereafter, Luke Skywalker, under guidance from the spirit of Kenobi, sought Yoda in his Dagobah exile to receive Jedi training.[7] At the same time, Yoda, stirred awake by the feeling of the dark side and the memories of his trauma years ago, went to his storage area to find it empty. In an effort to find food, he made the arduous trek across the wild terrain of Dagobah. Eventually, Yoda made it to a valley, full of colorful creatures, and another species in particular. Herds of these creatures ran through this valley, the best source of meat Yoda had yet been able to find.[110]\\n\\n     Luke Skywalker joins Yoda for dinner within the Jedi Master's hut.  \\nYears ago, Yoda in his shame had decided to give up his lightsaber, promising to never wield one again, taking a bow instead. To get what he came for, Yoda readied his bow and took aim of one of the creatures, easily killing it with one shot of the bow. On his journey back, Yoda began to feel the ground shift beneath his feet, beginning to crumble as Yoda began to fall. At the last moment, Yoda grabbed onto the side, reflecting on the similarities of this moment to his duel with Darth Sidious many years ago. Yoda's grip failed and he falls onto the ground below as boulders began to pile on top of him. Yoda fell unconscious.[110]\\nYoda began to dream, the dream of pain, suffering, anger, hate, and suddenly, he awoke once again. Realizing the predicament he was in, Yoda began to laugh, laughing at his foolishness for allowing him to get into this situation. He began to doubt himself, thinking of how he was now trapped on Dagobah, but subsiding those feelings, knowing he was one of the last of the Jedi. He reached out to the Force and, in that moment, he realized that his shame, his hubris, his blindness, had all clouded his vision and realized his failings as a Jedi. However, he knew that failure was the greatest lesson a Jedi could learn, and understanding this brought him peace as he rejected allowing his shame to guide him any more. With this newfound peace, Yoda reattuned to the light and used its power to move the boulders resting on top of him. With a newfound sense of responsibility and understanding, Yoda began his journey home.[110]\\nArriving back at his home, Yoda began to cook a stew, when he began to hear a crashing in the trees surrounding his hut. A visitor had arrived. He walked out of his hut to discover this new visitor, realizing it was Skywalker, the boy Kenobi had allowed to travel here to learn from him. As he stared at Skywalker from the trees, he came to the realization that he would not be the last Jedi, but only the instrument as to train the future.[110]\\n\\n     Yoda trains Luke Skywalker on Dagobah.  \\nWalking out, he decided to test the boy and did not reveal his true identity, instead promising to lead him to Yoda. With Skywalker growing annoyed while in Yoda's hut as the Jedi Master made rootleaf stew, Skywalker's subsequent frustration and his age made the Jedi doubtful as to whether it was a good idea to train the boy, but Kenobi's spirit managed to convince him to do so.[7] Over the next few weeks, Yoda trained the young Jedi.[116]\\nYoda proceeded to tutor Skywalker with a variety of exercises, including the telekinetic manipulation of objects in the area. As part of his training, he also sent Skywalker into the dark side cave in order to demonstrate the dangers of falling to the dark side of the Force. During his tenure with Yoda, Skywalker sensed that his friends were in danger in Cloud City on the gas giant Bespin, and headed there to confront Darth Vader in spite of Yoda's and Kenobi's persuasion to the contrary. Although Kenobi was distraught by Skywalker's rushed departure, Yoda reminded him that there was still another offspring of Anakin Skywalker[7]\\u2014Leia Organa.[117]\\n\\nA disturbance in the Force\\nSometime later, the same mysterious woman helped activate the Fermata Cage, a mysterious artifact created by Darth Momin. On her second attempt, Yoda along with other Force users amongst the galaxy sensed the disturbances emanating from the cage.[118]\\n\\nDeath\\n\\n\\\"Luke... when gone am I, the last of the Jedi, will you be. Luke... the Force runs strong in your family. Pass on what you have learned. Luke... There... is... another... Sk-... Sky... walker...\\\"\\n\\u2015Yoda's last words, to Luke Skywalker[117]\\n     Yoda becomes one with the Force.  \\nSkywalker, having engaged in a duel with Vader on Cloud City, returned to Dagobah after a year. Yoda,[117] ill and very close to death,[5] confirmed what Vader had revealed to the young Jedi on Bespin: that the Sith Lord indeed was Anakin Skywalker, his father. He also warned him that with his training fully complete, his final task would be confronting Vader again and defeating him, and cautioned Skywalker not to underestimate the Force powers of Galactic Emperor Darth Sidious. Yoda also said that when he dies, Luke will become the last of the Jedi. Therefore, he wanted Luke to pass on what he had learned. Finally, he also managed to inform him of the existence of another member of the Skywalker family. Yoda then died, and his body disappeared as he became one with the[117] light of the Force.[19]\\n\\nPostmortem and legacy\\n\\n\\\"Heeded my words not, did you? Pass on what you have learned. Strength, mastery. But weakness\\u2026 folly\\u2026 failure, also. Yes, failure most of all. The greatest teacher, failure is. Luke\\u2026 we are what they grow beyond. That is the true burden of all masters.\\\"\\n\\u2015Yoda's Force spirit, to Luke Skywalker[119]\\n     Anakin Skywalker, Yoda, and Obi-Wan Kenobi as Force spirits on Endor.  \\nThanks to the techniques passed on to him by Qui-Gon Jinn's spirit,[5] Yoda managed to retain his consciousness without a physical presence by becoming a Force spirit.[117] Mere moments after his death, he was able to appear to Sidious, who had felt his death in the Force. Sidious, who had been fantasizing about killing Yoda himself in the past few minutes as well as inwardly celebrating his demise, was surprised by Yoda's appearance, thinking the feat impossible. Putting on a show, he gloated on the fact that Yoda was now dead and implying that Yoda was there to witness Sidious' final glory as he crushed the remnants of the Rebel Alliance and took Luke Skywalker as his new apprentice. Yoda stressed that Sidious could not win, but Sidious pointed out that he already had. Awaiting Yoda's reply, Sidious discovered that his specter had vanished.[120]\\nLuke Skywalker later used the training he received to confront Darth Sidious and Darth Vader aboard the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station over the forest moon Endor as part of an all-out attack on the station by the anti-Imperial Rebel Alliance, defeating Vader and turning him back to the light side of the Force, resulting in Sidious' death at the hands of the redeemed Anakin Skywalker.[117] As Anakin died from his wounds, Yoda and Kenobi appeared to him, smiling upon their redeemed friend.[121]\\nYoda then taught Anakin the ability of retaining his consciousness after death.[17] As the rebels and Luke celebrated on the surface of the moon due to the demolition of the Death Star II and the deaths of Sidious and Vader, the ghosts of Anakin, Kenobi, and Yoda briefly appeared to Luke.[117] After that, Anakin asked Yoda and Kenobi whether Luke would be alright, and Kenobi responded as Yoda stood by.[121] For the next years, Yoda's spirit, alongside Obi-Wan and Anakin, continued to guide Luke.[122] Though it was rare, Yoda also spoke to Leia offering her guidance and teachings of the force over the years of her life, teachings she would later pass on to Rey.[123]\\nApproximately five years after Yoda's passing,[124] the Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin took a member of Yoda's species, Grogu, to train under Ahsoka Tano on the planet of Corvus. While with Djarin, Tano explained that she had only met one other member of Grogu's species: Master Yoda. Tano refused to train the Child but told Djarin that Grogu could reach out to other Jedi at the seeing stone on the planet of Tython.[125] Thus, Luke Skywalker learned of Grogu and, after saving Djarin, Grogu, and their allies from a Dark Trooper platoon, took Grogu as an apprentice.[126] Thirty years after Yoda's death,[3] another Force sensitive, Rey, heard Yoda's voice describing the Force during a vision she witnessed upon touching the lightsaber that previously belonged to Luke and Anakin Skywalker.[127]\\n\\n     Yoda appears before Luke on Ahch-To.  \\nSometime later, and after Rey had visited Luke on his hermit-island on Ahch-To, a disillusioned and self-loathing Skywalker tried to burn down what few Jedi artifacts and writings were left in hopes that it would rid the galaxy of the Jedi once and for all, who, through him, had failed. Luke was surprised by the sudden appearance of Master Yoda as a Force spirit, who not only did not seem to mind the ancient scripts burning up, but was the one to actually start the fire by causing lightning to strike the tree. In fact, unbeknownst to Luke, Rey had already taken the Sacred Jedi texts when she left. During their meeting, Yoda pointed out that mistakes and failure were important lessons, if not the most important lesson, for a Jedi Master. Ultimately, Yoda helped Skywalker come to terms with his failed training of Ben Solo, and to realize that despite his fear of failing another student he could still be what Rey needed. Inspiring Luke to face his past and forgive himself. This final, heartfelt meeting between the two friends led Luke to change his mind and help save the Resistance from certain defeat during the Battle of Crait.[119]\\nDuring the Battle of Exegol in 35 ABY, Yoda's voice was heard by Rey among the voices of many Jedi of the past who aided her with destroying the resurrected Darth Sidious. \\\"Alone, never have you been,\\\" he told her, before telling Rey to \\\"rise in the Force.\\\"[128]\\n\\nPersonality and traits\\n\\n\\\"You knew Master Yoda?\\\"\\\"Yes. He taught almost all of the younglings in the temple, at one point or another.\\\"\\\"Kanan described him to me. Small, green, and wrinkly with pointy ears. But he didn't know what he was really like.\\\"\\\"I'm not sure anyone did. He was wise, kind, but when I was young, he seemed happier. As the Clone War dragged on, he carried a great burden, a deep sorrow, as if he knew before anyone else that one time was ending, and another beginning.\\\"\\n\\u2015Ezra Bridger and Ahsoka Tano[106]\\n     Yoda served as a teacher for the Jedi for 800 years.  \\nKnown for his wisdom, Yoda had spent eight centuries training and tutoring generations of Jedi.[5] Yoda was an ideal grandmaster.[13] When he joined her Force-bond network, Jedi Master Avar Kriss felt Yoda's mind form its own part of the chorus of the Force. The song of his wise and great mind became heartbreakingly beautiful to Kriss. Despite his appearance not making it seem like it would be so, his voice appeared to be made up of pure light, so Kriss considered him the epitome that people were not simply the crude matter of their bodies,[25] a lesson that Yoda would later pass on to Luke Skywalker.[117] He was reluctant to accept Anakin Skywalker or Luke Skywalker for Jedi training, considering them unfit. In both cases, however, he allowed Obi-Wan Kenobi to persuade him into accepting them as trainees.[9][117]\\nYoda understood that nothing and no one was perfect, but that there was good or the potential for good everywhere and in everything. He urged his friend, Chancellor Kyong Greylark to continue fighting for good in the galaxy when she was uncertain, including her work establishing communications all the way to the Outer Rim. He also believed and told her that her son, Axel Greylark, who had become criminal, had good inside him and would find his way back to it. Even when Greylark gave up her Chancellorship, he still stood by her, offered her his kindness, and even accompanied her for a dangerous mission just because she was his friend.[30]\\nThere was a small garden in the Jedi Temple where Yoda often took to meditating, with the other Jedi usually respecting the privacy of such moments. Indeed, Yoda's favorite place to be was his own thoughts, being able to meditate and feel the calm Living Force flow throughout him.[64] When Dooku triggered a partial room collapse during his duel with Yoda on Geonosis, the Jedi, confronted with the choice of pursuing the fleeing Sith or protecting the hurt Obi-Wan Kenobi and unconscious Anakin Skywalker from the falling debris, opting to save his comrades instead of going after Dooku.[14] However, when fellow Master Plo Koon's fleet was destroyed by the Confederate superweapon Malevolence, Yoda forbade Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano to conduct a search for Koon, citing the danger posed by the Separatist vessel.[81] Early in the Clone Wars, after learning he would be confronting Dooku's apprentice Asajj Ventress during his mission on Rugosa, Yoda was disappointed to not be facing the Count himself, believing that he could end the bloodshed by meeting with Dooku; Yoda believed he could connect with his former Padawan and redeem him to the light side of the Force.[22] Later in the war, however, Yoda reluctantly agreed to a plan to assassinate Dooku in the name of stopping the war. Obi-Wan Kenobi, after the plan's failure, would argue to his fellow councilmembers the mission had been a step too far into the dark.[8]\\nPadawan Reath Silas believed that having Yoda as a master would be \\\"pretty fun\\\" whilst discussing Yoda's former apprentice Kantam Sy.[24] Yoda's favorite method of teaching was to ensure his students could figure things out for themselves. Even if all Yoda did was wait for the student to catch up to speed, he found that they almost always realized what they needed. When Master Mace Windu questioned whether Yoda had sensed something or not, he waited until the younger Jedi realized he was sensing nothing. Windu remained confused, forcing him to explain that the feeling of nothing needed to be caused by something. He disagreed with Windu's sentiment that \\\"nothing\\\" and \\\"something\\\" were always opposites, and he made sure to never be fully sure of himself, knowing there was more to learn. Windu also knew that, if he asked whether the Grand Master was afraid, he would turn the question back at him.[64]\\nYoda remained calm even when insulted, such as when the mud dwellers called him a \\\"weird little frog\\\".[129] During the Invasion of Naboo, Yoda believed himself comfortably away from the dark side, unaware of the growing power of Darth Sidious, with the exception of what he knew he could not feel. Indeed, Yoda concerned himself with trying to uncover the feelings that were hidden from his senses,[64] which he eventually understood to be the dark side.[14] Yoda was able to resist being tempted by the specter of the dead Sith Lord Darth Bane, who had appeared to him in a vision on the planet Moraband, recognizing that the spirit was a mere illusion and rejecting its call to the dark side.[95] However, he was quite concerned and worried about the danger and threat of the Nameless, which he secretly knew of quite well, opting to keep information about them out of the Jedi Archives so that they would not be known and used against the Order.[30]\\n\\n     Wise yet old, Yoda spent his final years on Dagobah, training Luke Skywalker and coming to terms with his own mortality.  \\nYoda's teachings stuck with his students, even if at times they had to struggle to understand their true meaning. Upon hearing pilot Leox Gyasi explain why he had named his starship \\\"the Vessel,\\\" Silas was struck with the opinion that Gyasi sounded like what Yoda's teachings would be like if the Jedi Master took spice. As such, Silas decided his reasoning was either a very good or extremely bad sign.[130] Despite barely knowing the Grand Master, Silas was greatly struck by his disappearance during the High Republic Era, with fellow Padawan Ram Jomaram, despite having never even met Yoda, agreeing and feeling the same.[24] As he neared his death before the Battle of Endor commenced, Yoda accepted his own mortality and imminent demise and died becoming one with the Force.[5] Yoda's ears were expressive and would sometimes curl when he was expressing strong emotions like surprise.[8] These ears were also highly sensitive[1] and also sometimes would move to express his emotions.[13] The Grandmaster preferred to not kill his enemies if it was not needed, if he had the opportunity to resolve a fight by disarming or overawing his foes. Yoda opposed profanity, urging others to not use such language.[131]\\nYoda also had a sense of humor and curiosity, despite his age and wisdom.[7] Part of the reason Yoda kept up his sense of humor was that Jedi Master Mace Windu, even as a youngling, did not respond well to it. As such, he took teasing his fellow council member, once asking if he had arrived for a private discussion because he had embarrassing questions, which Windu denied instantly. Afterward, he elected to wait to speak, wanting Windu to begin the discussion and viewing it as him cracking as if he was under pressure. Windu also found Yoda's behaviors distracting, yet he would always trust the older Jedi's judgement[64] and he himself described Yoda as \\\"hilarious\\\".[132] His sense of humor continued with others, as shown when he playfully rummaged through Luke's belongings when he first met him, fought R2-D2 for a torch,[7] and laughed gleefully when he supposedly set the ancient Jedi texts on fire, and finding Luke's continued ignorance amusing, commenting that he had \\\"missed him.\\\"[119] Also when Kenobi told him about the planet Kamino missing from the archives during his class, he responded with, \\\"Lost a planet, Master Kenobi has. How embarrassing. How embarrassing!\\\"[14] Being unable to destroy Darth Sidious and bring down the Empire made him sad.[133][10]\\nYoda was highly secretive about his homeworld and never revealed it to anyone.[1] Despite his intensive Jedi training and high status within the Order, he stated that he secretly had a dislike for ancient Jedi texts.[119] He had a distinctive and peculiar speech pattern: namely, he would rearrange words in his sentences, placing subject and object in front of the verb; for example, he would frame sentences like \\\"Good relations with the Wookiees, I have.\\\"[10]\\n\\nPowers and abilities\\n     Yoda was one of the most proficient Jedi with the lightsaber.  \\nLightsaber combat\\n\\n\\\"It is obvious that this contest cannot be decided by our knowledge of the Force\\u2026but by our skills with a lightsaber.\\\"\\n\\u2015Dooku, to Yoda[14]\\nDespite his small size and old age, Yoda was an extremely accomplished lightsaber duelist, wielding a short green-bladed lightsaber.[10][14] Yoda used the Ataru saber form, boosting his body with the Force to be able to perform the needed movements.[134] Such was his mastery of this form that Yoda could duel Sidious and almost defeated the Sith.[10] Yoda was a master of the Niman style of lightsaber combat, retaining his skills with the form for his whole life.[135]\\nYoda was extremely skilled in blast-deflection and proved more than capable of taking on multiple enemies at the same time and winning easily: he was able to single-handedly defeat without getting even a single shot to his person an entire army of droids that Ventress sent as a test for King Katunko whether to accept the Jedi or the Separatists as an ally.[76]\\nThe greatest display of Yoda's skills with a lightsaber was when he dueled the Sith Lords Count Dooku[14] and Darth Sidious. When he fought Dooku, Yoda maintained the upper hand through the duel, forcing Dooku into the defensive, and would have defeated him had he not decided to flee. His duel with Sidious, although initially well-matched, eventually began to turn into Yoda's favor, forcing Sidious to use the Force to confront him.[10]\\n\\nForce powers\\n\\n\\\"The history of a soul, does the Force permit me to understand.\\\"\\n\\u2015Yoda about his abilities[8]\\nEven despite his small size and old age, Yoda was extremely powerful and accomplished in the Force. with a connection to that power and knowledge of Force techniques that may well have surpassed that of any other Jedi.[7][135] Obi-Wan Kenobi considered Yoda to be the most powerful Jedi he ever knew.[129] The Grandmaster was heralded as the greatest Jedi of all time, at least until the fall of the Republic. Yoda was utterly committed to the light side, but he also had a deep understanding of the dark side as well as how both halves of the Force interacted.[135] The idea he was the greatest of the Jedi went back centuries, at being held least to 232 BBY.[25][136] The toll age took on Yoda's body did not prevent him from still being strong in the Force when Luke Skywalker trained under him.[122] Even in death, as a Force spirit, he had power over weather.[119]\\n\\n     Yoda uses the Force to lift Skywalker's X-wing out of the Dagobah swamp.  \\nYoda was extremely skilled in telekinesis and all forms of it. When on a mission to free a child, Yoda gripped two pirates who were holding the child and held them helpless, before making them punch each other and then threw them into the air. Then Yoda defeated the rest of the pirates in the room when they attacked him.[137] Yoda used Force deflection against a Blue stone spear thrown at him by a member of the Mud dwellers, though holding the spear with the Force was hard for Yoda. Yoda then levitated many boulders and rocks to catch the rest of the spears thrown at him and kept the rocks levitated for a whole conversation. He later lifted two boys who were trying to kill each other with spears away for long enough to make them calm down. Yoda was unable to repel many of the Blue stones that were thrown at him with the Force by the Rockhawkers, due to how hard it was to affect with telekinesis and his unwillingness to harm the children he faced.[129] Later, and having mastered Stonepower, Yoda was able to casually blast the Rockhawkers who attacked him, subduing and disarming them without inflicting lasting harm.[11]\\nWhen facing Dooku on the planet Geonosis, Yoda demonstrated his superior telekinetic mastery by effortlessly repelling every metal piece and stone slab thrown by the very skilled Sith Lord. During a confrontation with Confederate forces on the coral moon of Rugosa, Yoda effortlessly pulled two droids to slash them with his lightsaber, flung multiple pieces of the droid controlling one of the infantry high into the air and both opened the upper parts of another infantry tank, then sent it and the droid controlling it into the air. It was with ease that Yoda raised and moved droids to fire upon their allies and slammed whole squads of droids down, without harming his own allies. After the droids were dealt with, Yoda easily overpowered the powerful Sith Assassin Asajj Ventress with telekinesis, stopping her lightsaber strike mid-way and disarming her with a simple gesture, and repulsed the many stones caused by Ventress activating an explosion.[76] If Yoda had no desire to touch the ground, he could simply float in a mediative state.[138]\\nForce barriers were a tool in Yoda's skill set, as seen when he stopped a cloud of deadly gas.[85] Yoda could strike down his foes by hurling his saber at them, guiding the blow with his telekinetic skills. When he went to try to destroy the Sith Emperor, Yoda effortlessly defeated two Red Guards by knocking them into a wall. He was even able to breach the Emperor's defenses and blast Darth Sidious himself through the air with a Force push and was able to stop and throw a Senate hoverpod Sidious had thrown at him when they fought in the Senate building, an all the more impressive feat since it was thrown upwards against gravity.[10] Later, on Dagobah, Yoda used the Force to throw a pot at an Imperial Probe Droid, destroying it. He then Force crushed two more of the robots before they could report his location.[104] In order to teach Luke Skywalker that anything was possible with the Force, Yoda levitated his student's sunken T-65B X-wing starfighter out of a swamp of Dagobah and onto dry land with no visible strain.[7]\\nWith just a few days of training, Yoda was able to learn how to use Stonepower and thus deflect Blue stones thrown at him. Yoda could move a chunk three times his size--something unknown to his master, though Yoda was then exhausted by doing so.[139] Yoda could also use Stonepower to stop strikes from giants of living stone, and with the aid of those he taught, call forth other giants to defeat the one he was fighting.[11] Yoda was capable of employing the power of Force lightning, to the point that he could make several arcs of energy lance out in different directions from only a single finger.[140] Yoda could manipulate flames with the Force.[139]\\nJedi Padawan Bell Zettifar pondered whether Yoda, after putting great focus into the effort, could use the Force to stop gravity.[25] In his duel with both Sith Lords Count Dooku and Darth Sidious, Yoda displayed great proficiency in Force Deflection, as he was able to easily stop and then redirect Dooku's Force lightning attack with his bare hands and even managed to stop Sidious' Force lightning attack using just his palms but was unable to deflect it completely: the energy eventually exploded and flung both of the combatants away from each other, ending the duel in a stalemate and causing Yoda to escape.[10] Yoda could dampen or even negate the might of Force powers used to attack him by radiating a calming aura.[135] Yoda could employ the Force to absorb blaster fire and negate the strikes of lightsabers with his bare hands and channel the energy from blasters or lightning he absorbed into making his own attacks such as Force push and Force lightning more deadly.[138]\\n\\n     Yoda was capable of absorbing and deflecting Force lightning with his palms.  \\nHis ability to use the combative applications of the Force notwithstanding, Yoda's incredibly strong connection to the Force combined with his years of extensive study also granted him numerous supplementary abilities. Yoda could enhance himself and seek out objects or persons he knew about regardless of the distance, and easily see though and/or destroy many Force illusions at once.[135] During the trial of Quinlan Vos, Yoda revealed that he could uncover the alignment of a Force-user just by touching them; stating that the Force had permitted him to read the history of a soul, able to easily sense that he had fallen to the Dark Side despite Vos being proficient enough to hide it from many other Jedi.[8] Yoda could detect the lies, emotional states, and thoughts of those he interacted with.[129][135]\\nWhile physically isolated on Dagobah, Yoda was able to see other Jedi that were active in the Force; he could not see one that had forsaken the ways of the Jedi, with the exception of Vader who was still exposed to his monitoring.[141][104] Yoda could detect living things and droids with the Force and while on Dagobah he could sense all droids on the entire planet or the lack thereof.[135][22] He could keep in mental contact with the Jedi Temples across the galaxy, and telepathically converse with any Jedi\\u2013even to the point of manipulating the experience to his desires\\u2013within them by accessing the World Between Worlds.[109][135] Yoda, still on Dagobah, was able to conjure an illusion of the Grand Inquisitor (from when he was a Jedi) to fight Kanan Jarrus as a test and sight of worthiness. He also sensed that the place where Ezra Bridger and Kanan Jarrus could be assured of a chance to fight the Sith was Malachor, and so told Ezra. When the Lothal Jedi Temple was invaded, Yoda sent illusions of Jedi Temple Guards at the Inquisitors, subduing them for long enough for the living Jedi present to flee.[106]\\nWith some effort, Yoda could make himself and the powers he invoked impossible to detect with the Force and go unnoticed by most.[135] When two Blue stone spears were struck together, Yoda sensed the disturbance this caused.[137] He also sensed the killings that took place during Order 66, the shock of which literarily staggered him, so forewarned by the Force, Yoda was able to destroy the Clones soon sent to slay him on behalf of the Sith.[10] He also was able to sense when a battle was going to happen, getting an identifiable feeling that he felt shortly before the Night of Sorrow.[30] Yoda could use the Force to see even in total darkness or when blinded.[135] Additionally, Yoda was able to use Force healing, even to the extent of healing himself and those around him while in battle with just a wave of his hand.[138][135] Yoda was also shown to be capable of experiencing Force visions and could invoke such insights at will for information up to three days into his personal future.[135] However, he understood that Force prophecy was not absolute and that the future was always in motion.[7] The Grandmaster could make great leaps with the Force, to maneuver and dodge[76] and charge.[14] His visions led him to foresee the possible, and eventually actual, fall of the Jedi in the Clone Wars and even his own death.[95] Yoda sometimes knew if he was probably going to die in a battle he fought in and could augment his physical abilities.[11]\\nHe also was able to fully master the skill of maintaining consciousness after death, something that Qui-Gon Jinn was unable to do, allowing him to manifest a visible presence rather than simply being a disembodied voice.[117] As a Force spirit, Yoda was capable of manipulating weather to create lightning strikes. He was also shown to be capable of striking Luke Skywalker with his walking stick, demonstrating an ability to interact with the living world in a physical sense despite both Yoda and the stick being ostensibly non-corporeal.[119]\\n\\nOther skills\\nYoda was also known to have a level of proficiency in piloting[137] despite often leaving it to his soldiers, as when he was forced to travel alone by Qui-Gon Jinn, Yoda displayed the ability to pilot Anakin's personal interceptor comfortably and was able to avoid inflicting any damage on it until he returned to the Jedi.[94][59][95] Sidious and Yoda were equally matched during their duel in the Galactic Senate.[1]\\nAccording to Obi-Wan, Yoda's thirst for knowledge was the grandmaster's greatest weapon. Yoda could walk for hours without food or rest up a mountain/giant.[139] Padawan Reath Silas once reflected that he could feel Yoda's wisdom and knowledge from even a kilometer away.[24]\\nDuring the Clone Wars, Yoda proved himself to be an exceptional strategist and leader, being a highly effective general. His abilities in those regard were displayed during a confrontation with Confederate forces on the coral moon of Rugosa: Yoda was able to inspire hope into his troopers despite the overwhelming odds and was able to easily tactically defeat the army of droids, exploiting the weak-points of the infantry and tanks to systematically destroy them and at one point tricking one of the droids controlling the tanks into destroying the other tank.[76]\\nYoda was a skilled diplomat.[76] Although his cooking on Dagobah left much to be desired,[116] Yoda was skilled at baking, with Jedi Master Torban Buck particularly enjoying Yoda's pastry recipe.[44]\\n\\nEquipment\\n\\n\\\"I am knowledgeable of many things. But I have never worn shoes!\\\"\\n\\u2015Yoda[142]\\nThroughout the Republic Era, Yoda wielded a shoto-style lightsaber, although he lost it in a duel with Darth Sidious at the end of the Clone Wars. He kept a near identical lightsaber with him on Dagobah. He was also known for using a cane. It began as a lesson, but really more of a joke, for his Padawans; he would limp into a room with the cane, then he would cast it aside and quickly use his speed in the Force, only to finally grab the cane once more and hobble away. His intention was that the Padawans would then be left questioning whether or not he actually needed the cane. Nevertheless, as he grew older during his exile on Dagobah, he found he truly had come to need it.[104] As a Force ghost, he was able to manifest his staff and use it to strike living matter.[119] His cane was made from a Gimer stick which released natural plant substances that helped him meditate when he chewed upon it. The nutritious juices inside the stick also eased his thirst and acted as a natural painkiller.[17]\\n\\nBehind the scenes\\nThe Original trilogy\\n\\n\\\"The idea of using another person, perhaps an alien, for Luke to play off of came up during story meetings. George Lucas and Leigh Brackett thought that the alien could be an Indian desert type, very childlike even though he's an old man. He at first should be repulsive and slimy but then should become kind and wise. He appears as a crazy little nitwit that goes around scurrying like a rat but ultimately teaches Luke a great deal about the Force.\\\"\\n\\u2015Laurent Bouzereau about Yoda's development for Episode V[143]\\n     Early concept art by Joe Johnston.  \\nThe character of Yoda made his first appearance in the 1980 film Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back, and subsequently appeared in Star Wars: Episode VI Return of the Jedi, the closing installment of the original trilogy. He was also featured in all three episodes of the prequel trilogy, and multiple episodes of the Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels animated television series. Yoda also played a role in various Expanded Universe material now under the Star Wars Legends brand and thus non-canonical.[144] In George Lucas' notes for the first chapter of the original trilogy Yoda originally named as \\\"Bunden Debannen\\\" and nicknamed as \\\"Buffy\\\". During the development of the sequel, Lucas, likening the character to \\\"a little Dalai Lama\\\", decided to use an eastern sounding name and changed the character's name to \\\"Minch Yoda\\\" in the resultant treatment before simply shortened it to \\\"Yoda\\\" for the final film.[145][146]\\nMuch of the information and training that Yoda gave to Luke on Dagobah was originally going to be given by Ben Kenobi, but due to Kenobi's death in A New Hope, George Lucas conceived Yoda to fulfill the role of Luke's teacher after Kenobi's death.[147] Early concepts of Yoda imagined him as a large alien before he was reimplemented as a tiny one, with various gnome\\u2013 and elfin-like portrayals being created by the design team of Episode V. Once Yoda's appearance was finalized, make-up and creatures supervisor Stuart Freeborn created a detailed puppet, brought to life on screen by Frank Oz.[145] Every time that Oz turned the puppet, the ears would do a little wiggle, which he did not like. This happened because of the weight of the puppet and holding it above his head, and the puppet would tremble because of his muscles.[148]\\nYoda had additional play in the draft script for Return of the Jedi: when Emperor Palpatine strikes at Luke Skywalker with Force lightning aboard Death Star II, the Force ghost of Yoda would have appeared alongside the ghost of Kenobi. Both Jedi would have deflected the Emperor's lightning to protect Luke. Like Anakin Skywalker and Kenobi did in the draft, Yoda also returned to life instead of remaining a ghost.[149]\\n\\nThe Prequel trilogy\\n\\n\\\"I thought, 'I don't want to be matching to the puppet.' I adored the puppet in Empire when I was 16 years old\\u2026 But when it came time to do Attack of the Clones, I felt that it would be really, really difficult, because we would have to match what they did with the puppet and interpret how that puppet movement would be put into a digital character running around. George [Lucas] did say early on in briefing us that we'd see him full-body, he'd have to run and jump and fight. So I did know that, but I thought after learning what we learned on Watto, Jar Jar, and Sebulba [in Episode I], I felt we could take on Yoda.\\\"\\n\\u2015Rob Coleman discussing creating a digital Yoda for Episode II[148]\\nA new model, younger in appearance, was built by Nick Dudman's animatronics crew for the filming of Episode I, in which Yoda also appeared as a CGI model for two shots' duration.[145] In Episode II, Yoda needed to be more agile than he was in the original trilogy and would have to fight[148] during his duel with Dooku,[145] which was a creative risk for the film. Initially, Lucas told Animation Director Rob Coleman that Yoda would be featured as a puppet and the animators would create a digital version of him for his duel with Count Dooku, but Coleman did not love the idea. He thought that it would be very difficult to match what was done for the Yoda puppet in The Empire Strikes Back and interpret how the puppet's movement would be put into a digital character. Early on in briefing, Lucas told Coleman and his team that Yoda would be seen full-body and he would have to run, jump, and fight. Coleman felt like he and his team could work on Yoda after gaining knowledge and experience from working on Watto, Jar Jar Binks, and Sebulba in The Phantom Menace. The new goal was to use a digital Yoda for every scene and sequence that he appeared in.[148] Designed specifically to not exceed Oz's puppetwork in realism, the animated version of Yoda was accepted after Coleman's crew secretly developed animation tests using key scenes from The Empire Strikes Back using the new technology, and these scenes were evaluated. Based on the strength of these animated tests, Coleman's crew was given permission to create a digital Yoda, which was realized entirely through computer-generated imagery.[145]\\nCreating a digital Yoda terrified Coleman because of the backlash against Jar Jar, and he did not want to be known for \\\"wrecking\\\" Yoda, but he was unwilling to back down from a challenge. Coleman's memory of seeing Yoda in 1980 managed to keep him on target. Coleman studied the footage of Yoda in the Empire Strikes Back frame by frame and realized it was very limited. When creating the digital Yoda, he wanted himself and his team to honor the range of motion he thought he saw in 1980.[148] Coleman pitched that the digital Yoda would do three talking shots[148] while delivering memorable lines of dialogue,[145] as well as three shots without talking[148] to show the ability to convey a performance even when silent.[145] Coleman worked on a closeup of Yoda for the film in which Palpatine was speaking to Jedi in his office, and Lucas purposefully cut to Yoda who was looking over his shoulder. This was meant to indicate that Yoda did not trust Palpatine.[148]\\nColeman worked with Frank Oz in order to make sure that his digital Yoda could be as faithful as possile. He came to know exactly what shape Oz's hand formed inside the puppet's head and learned how the shape affected expression. Coleman made sure that he did not go too far in terms of Yoda's movement. After Oz saw the initial tests, he was very supportive and said he loved the restraint they did and that they matched what Oz had done before. At first, the digital character did not include the original detail of how Yoda's ears wiggled everytime the puppet's head moved. This caused Yoda to not appear old, which was considered to be a vital part of his character. Coleman's team added the detail in the digital character, and Yoda now looked the correct age.[148]\\nFrom the start of the creation of Yoda and Count Dooku's lightsaber duel, most of the work would fall to Coleman's team. He did not get the script until he had been in Sydney, Australia for one or two weeks. The first draft described the fight as \\\"'In a fight that defies description, Yoda and Count Dooku battle.\\\" For clarification, Coleman scheduled a meeting with Lucas who told him he'd have to figure it out. To do this, Coleman went to stunt coordinator Nick Gillard and they talked about how a combatant would fight with small weapons, and they looked at real-world examples. Also, Ahmed Best, the actor who played Jar Jar, introduced Coleman to some anime[148] and martial arts[150] that he thought could be helpful. However, Coleman still was not sure how to depict Yoda's speed and style in a fight. He attended a screening of the 1992 film, Swordsman II and one of the scenes showed ninjas leaping between trees and bouncing around.[148] Coleman studied the action in the film,[150] and this inspired him to give Yoda the ability to jump around.[148] While working on the duel, Coleman referred to Glen McIntosh's dynamic drawings.[150] In the duel, Lucas wanted a shot of Yoda pulling back his duster to reveal his lightsaber as a reference to the iconic shot of the gunfighter at the O.K Corral.[148] After finishing the duel, Lucas and Coleman felt happy with it. Despite Coleman's concerns, Lucas wanted Yoda to jump, leap, and flip during the duel.[148]\\nColeman worked on a shot that was called \\\"The Widowmaker.\\\" In the shot, an animated Yoda denounced Kenobi's sense of victory and said \\\"Begun, this Clone War has.\\\" That line was approved and unapproved a couple of times. Also, Coleman received many notes telling him the line had to be sadder. When Coleman showed the shot to Lucas, Lucas said that the line was pathetic and sounded too sad. Lucas said Yoda should not sound sad, and should instead sound reflective, concerned, and upset over the inevitability of the Clone Wars.[151]\\nFor Episode III, the shot of Yoda clinging to the Senate podium during his duel with Sidious was animated by Tim Harrington. Coleman thought that his blocking was excellent, but Coleman was looking for more strain on Yoda's face. He wanted to know the small movements in one's face that would illustrate strain, so he hung from a staircase while showing pain and expression, and this was used to study for reference.[152]\\n\\nAnimated television shows\\n     Character studies of Yoda created for The Clone Wars episode \\\"Ambush.\\\"  \\nYoda's Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars Forces of Destiny incarnation was voiced by veteran Star Wars voice actor Tom Kane.[153] During the Revenge of the Sith DVD press conference in 2005, Oz initially mentioned that he was going to be involved in the Clone Wars series, but in a 2007 interview with Aintitcoolnews.com he eventually denied any involvement.[154] In spite of this, Oz later returned to voice the character in Star Wars Rebels. Piotr Michael provided the voice for Star Wars: Young Jedi Adventures.\\n\\nThe Sequel trilogy\\n\\n\\\"Neal Scanlan and his team did a recreation of the Yoda puppet. It's not only a puppet, it's an exact replica of the Empire puppet. They found the original molds for it. They found the woman that painted the original eyes for Yoda. Then Frank came and worked with them for a few weeks to get the puppet right. He did a lot of testing and a lot of adjusting with the puppet creators. It was amazing to watch the process.\\\"\\n\\u2015Rian Johnson[155]\\nOz continued to perform as Yoda in all three films of the sequel trilogy: the 2015 film Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens,[156] the 2017 film Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi,[119] and the 2019 film Star Wars: Episode IX The Rise of Skywalker.[128] In The Force Awakens, Yoda's voice was heard during Rey's Force vision along with Obi-Wan Kenobi's. During the film's early development, Yoda was originally going to have a bigger role, a decision that went far enough to ask Frank Oz to record some lines as Yoda, although these recordings went unused when the character was cut from the film.[157] The Last Jedi director Rian Johnson praised the development process for Yoda's appearance in the film.[158]\\n\\nDiscrepancies\\nThe number of toes on Yoda's feet has long been debated. In Star Wars: Absolutely Everything You Need to Know, Yoda is given as having three toes at the front of each of his feet, and one at the back, comparing them with that of many birds.[23]\\n\\nNon-canon appearances\\nOn October 29, 2014, for a Halloween-themed update, a costume of Yoda was added to The Sims 4 for playable child Sims to wear in-game. The costume is purely cosmetic and offers no gameplay changes.[159]\\n\\nAppearances\\n\\nExplore all of Wookieepedia's media for this article subject:Audio\\u00a0\\u00b7\\u00a0Images\\nStar Wars:

I was on a bad path, and Chewie, he put me straight. Saved my shanks more than once too.\\\"\\n\\u2015Han Solo, on Chewbacca[17]\\nChewbacca, known affectionately to his friends as Chewie, was a Wookiee male warrior, smuggler, mechanic, pilot, and resistance fighter who fought in the Clone Wars, the Galactic Civil War, the Cold War, and the subsequent First Order-Resistance War. He hailed from the planet Kashyyyk where he was born during the High Republic Era and became a Wookiee military leader. During the Clone Wars, he was captured by Trandoshan slavers and held captive on Wasskah, but he worked with a fellow captive, Jedi Commander Ahsoka Tano, to escape. He later commanded Wookiee forces of the Kachirho Wookiee Militia during the Battle of Kashyyyk alongside the Grand Army of the Republic, led by Jedi General Yoda. During the battle, one of the last ones of the war, Yoda's clone troopers received Order 66 from Supreme Chancellor Palpatine and, with the help of Chewbacca and his fellow Wookiee Chieftain and General Tarfful, Yoda escaped Kashyyyk and the destruction of the Jedi Order.\\nIn the years that followed, during the rule of the Galactic Empire, Chewbacca was enslaved by the Empire until he was rescued by Corporal Han Solo, becoming his co-pilot aboard the Millennium Falcon during coaxium run for Crimson Dawn with Tobias Beckett and Qi'ra. Winning the Falcon from Landonis Balthazar Calrissian, they later worked in the employ of crime lord Jabba the Hutt until Solo was forced to dump a shipment of spice to avoid trouble with the Empire, at which point a bounty was placed on their heads. Soon thereafter, Chewbacca and Solo were hired by Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi to ferry him, Luke Skywalker, C-3PO, and R2-D2 to Alderaan on a mission vital to the survival of the Alliance to Restore the Republic. After finding Alderaan was destroyed, the group was brought aboard the Death Star, where they helped Princess Leia Organa escape from captivity and return to the Rebel base on Yavin 4. Though Chewbacca and Solo initially chose to leave Yavin 4 and not join the Rebellion, they ended up fighting in the Battle of Yavin and were instrumental in Skywalker's destruction of the Death Star, a major victory for the Rebellion.\\nThroughout the war, Chewbacca and Solo fought the Empire in a number of engagements, including an assault on Cymoon 1 and the battle on Vrogas Vas. Along with Princess Organa and C-3PO, they escaped from Echo Base on the planet Hoth after the Empire tracked the Rebel Alliance there. The group sought refuge with Calrissian on Cloud City, but Calrissian betrayed them and turned them over to Darth Vader, the Emperor's chief enforcer, after his city was threatened. Solo was frozen in carbonite and Calrissian helped the others escape, but they were too late to save the frozen Solo from being taken by Boba Fett to Jabba the Hutt. Chewbacca and Calrissian set off to find Solo and located him in Jabba's Palace on Tatooine, where Chewbacca and his friends saved Solo and destroyed Jabba. Shortly thereafter, they fought in the Battle of Endor, where Chewbacca helped destroy the shield generator and allowed the Alliance Fleet to destroy the DS-2 Death Star II Mobile Battle Station. The Emperor was killed for the first time aboard the battle station, delivering a crippling blow to the Empire.\\nAfter Endor and the rise of the New Republic, Chewbacca and Solo fought to liberate Kashyyyk from the Empire. When the war finally came to a close, Chewbacca returned home to Kashyyyk with his family. After Solo's son Ben, turned to the dark side and destroyed Skywalker's new generation of Jedi, Chewbacca reunited with his old friend and the two spent many years as smugglers once more. They lost the Millennium Falcon and ended up smuggling aboard a ship called the Eravana, but they eventually found the Falcon and, with it, stowaways named Rey, Finn, and the droid BB-8. The droid had part of a map that led to the exiled Luke Skywalker, so the group brought the map to the Resistance that opposed the First Order, which had risen from the ashes of the Galactic Empire. Chewbacca soon fought in the assault to destroy Starkiller Base, a devastating First Order superweapon, a conflict in which Solo lost his life at the hands of his son. After the base was destroyed, Chewbacca joined Rey in traveling to the planet Ahch-To on the Falcon, where they found Luke Skywalker. After Solo's death, Chewbacca often served as the sole pilot of the Falcon, including piloting the ship to aid the Resistance during the Battle of Crait.\\nRoughly a year after the battle of Crait, Chewbacca was one of the last of the Resistance. Having learned of the mysterious return of the Emperor, Chewbacca and the crew of the Falcon, now including Poe Dameron, traveled to the planets Pasaana and Kijimi to find a clue to how to find where the Emperor was hiding, being reunited with his friend Calrissian in the process. The quest nearly ended in Chewbacca's death, as Rey, having been revealed to be the Emperor's granddaughter through his son, lashed out with dark power during a fight with Kylo Ren and destroyed a First Order transport that she had thought Chewbacca had been loaded onto, seemingly killing him.\\nHowever, Chewbacca survived and was rescued by the Resistance as they continued the quest. Rey eventually found Exegol during a failed self-exile attempt to protect the galaxy from her becoming a Sith, and led the charge during the battle that ensued later on. Rey ultimately killed her malevolent grandfather with the help of the returned Ben Solo in the climax of the battle, while the Resistance, joined by the Citizens' Fleet, progressively overpowered the Sith Eternal's Final Order fleet that the Emperor planned to unleash.\\nHaving destroyed the Sith once and for all, the Resistance reveled in their victory, but also mourned their losses, including Leia, who had died of natural causes shortly after reaching out to her son and helping him turn back towards the light.\\n\\nContents\\n\\n1 Biography\\n\\n1.1 Early life\\n1.2 The Clone Wars\\n\\n1.2.1 Meeting Ahsoka Tano\\n1.2.2 Battle of Kashyyyk\\n\\n\\n1.3 Rise of the Empire\\n\\n1.3.1 Capture\\n1.3.2 Meeting Han Solo\\n1.3.3 Meeting Lando Calrissian\\n1.3.4 The Kessel Run\\n1.3.5 Savareen\\n1.3.6 The Falcon\\n1.3.7 The Cordaxian Sea\\n1.3.8 Bounty hunted\\n\\n1.3.8.1 Dropping Jabba's cargo\\n1.3.8.2 Making repairs\\n1.3.8.3 Freeing the prisoners\\n1.3.8.4 Versus the Mist Hunter\\n1.3.8.5 Working together\\n\\n\\n1.3.9 Mission to Ushruu\\n\\n1.3.9.1 False pretenses\\n1.3.9.2 Acquiring the artifact\\n1.3.9.3 Saving Han\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1.4 Galactic Civil War\\n\\n1.4.1 Death Star rescue\\n1.4.2 Yavin 4\\n1.4.3 Cyrkon\\n1.4.4 Andelm IV\\n1.4.5 Cymoon 1\\n1.4.6 Nar Shaddaa\\n1.4.7 Vrogas Vas\\n1.4.8 The Harbinger\\n1.4.9 Skorii-Lei\\n1.4.10 The Screaming Citadel\\n1.4.11 The Hutt Run\\n1.4.12 Odona\\n1.4.13 Hoth\\n1.4.14 Cloud City\\n1.4.15 Rendezvous Point Delta-Three\\n1.4.16 Return to Tatooine\\n1.4.17 Tarkin's prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9 and Operation Starlight\\n1.4.18 Return to Nar Shaddaa\\n\\n1.4.18.1 A familiar smell\\n1.4.18.2 Skywalker and Sagwa\\n\\n\\n1.4.19 Arrival at Jekara\\n1.4.20 The auction\\n1.4.21 Rebels in space\\n1.4.22 Dawn of a revelation\\n1.4.23 Readying for assault\\n1.4.24 The hunt for Zhara and Unity Day\\n1.4.25 Solo's rescue\\n1.4.26 Endor\\n1.4.27 Shattering the Empire\\n\\n\\n1.5 New Republic\\n\\n1.5.1 Return to Kashyyyk\\n\\n1.5.1.1 False starts\\n1.5.1.2 Escaping Ashmead's Lock\\n1.5.1.3 Liberation of Kashyyyk\\n1.5.1.4 Reunion with Waroo\\n\\n\\n1.5.2 Peaceful retirement\\n1.5.3 Smuggler's Run\\n\\n\\n1.6 Cold war\\n\\n1.6.1 Recovering the Millennium Falcon\\n1.6.2 Confronting the First Order\\n1.6.3 Time on Ahch-To\\n\\n\\n1.7 Adventures after the Battle of Crait\\n1.8 First Order-Resistance War\\n\\n1.8.1 Mission to the Sinta Glacier Colony\\n1.8.2 Mission to Pasaana\\n1.8.3 Rescue on Kijimi\\n1.8.4 Loss at Kef Bir\\n1.8.5 Battle of Exegol\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2 Personality and traits\\n3 Skills and abilities\\n4 Behind the scenes\\n\\n4.1 Appearances\\n4.2 Creating the look\\n\\n\\n5 Appearances\\n\\n5.1 Non-canon appearances\\n\\n\\n6 Sources\\n\\n6.1 Non-canon sources\\n\\n\\n7 Notes and references\\n8 External links\\n\\n\\nBiography[]\\nEarly life[]\\n\\n\\\"Hey, you're the married one.

His exploration hardened his footpads.[6]\\n\\nThe Clone Wars[]\\nMeeting Ahsoka Tano[]\\n\\n\\\"It's a Wookiee!\\\"\\n\\u2015Ahsoka Tano on first seeing Chewbacca[21]\\n     Chewbacca hides alongside Ahsoka Tano.  \\nAt some point during the Clone Wars, a galaxy-spanning conflict between the Galactic Republic and the Separatists,[1] Chewbacca famously shielded his allies.[22] Fighting with courage to defend both Kashyyyk and the Republic,[23] he served as a combat engineer while other Wookiee soldiers led the charge in battle.[6] In 20 BBY,[24] he was captured by a Trandoshan hunting guild led by Garnac; taken to Island Four on Wasskah to be their prey, his transport was attacked by a trio of Jedi apprentices\\u2014the Padawan Ahsoka Tano and the younglings Jinx and O-Mer, also prey of the Trandoshans.[21]\\nChewbacca escaped from the wreckage and followed the trio, with whom he communicated with thanks to Tano's understanding of Shyriiwook, to their hideout. Using his technical expertise and parts from the crashed transport, he constructed a transmitter to contact his people on his nearby homeworld; however, it seemingly failed and an impatient Jinx, supported by O-Mer, decided to lure down and hijack a hunting pod and take the base ship. As persuaded by Tano, Chewbacca joined in their endeavor and raided the Trandoshan base, only to be joined by a Wookiee relief force led by[21] his old friend[25] General Tarfful\\u2014who had received Chewbacca's transmission\\u2014as well as bounty hunters Sugi and Seripas. Once all the Trandoshans had been killed, Chewbacca and the Wookiees accompanied the young Jedi to the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, where they parted ways.[21]\\n\\nBattle of Kashyyyk[]\\n\\n\\\"Good-bye, Tarfful. Good-bye, Chewbacca. Miss you I will.\\\"\\n\\u2015Yoda, shortly before his departure from Kashyyyk\\u00a0\\u2014  Listen (file info)[1]\\n     Clone Commander Gree, Yoda, and Chewbacca on Kashyyyk  \\nDuring the last days of the war,[1] Lieutenant[26] Chewbacca was a major player in the Battle of Kashyyyk, overseeing the confrontation between the Grand Army of the Republic and the invading Separatist Droid Army alongside Tarfful and Jedi General Yoda, as well as Jedi Master Luminara Unduli. Following the implementation of Order 66, Chewbacca and Tarfful witnessed the assassination attempt on Yoda by Commander Gree and his aide; he helped the Jedi Grand Master elude the clone troopers and escape from the planet.[1]\\n\\nRise of the Empire[]\\nCapture[]\\nFollowing the reorganization of the Republic into the Galactic Empire, Chewbacca saw his people sent to work as slaves,[19] or as miners in places such as Kessel,[27] or made to serve as science experiments.[14] A year into the Empire's reign, former Padawan Ahsoka Tano, the very same Force-sensitive Chewbacca had met on Wasskah, pondered what had happened to him after reading updates on the state of Kashyyyk, starting to lose her hope that he remained free.[28]\\n\\n     Chewbacca is enslaved along with several other Wookiees.  \\nAt some point, while on the run from Imperial forces,[29] Chewbacca and several other Wookiees were captured and enslaved by several Trandoshan slavers.[30] Like them, he was forced into slavery, working to cut the wroshyr trees in order to feed the Imperial Army.[14] Chewbacca temporarily escaped but was turned over to the Empire by a back-stabbing[31] and greedy[4] Kowakian monkey-lizard[31] bounty hunter.[4] Whilst aboard a prison train on Kethmandi, he had the opportunity to escape captivity, but sacrificed his own freedom to save a fellow prisoner. He bounced around at other Imperial facilities before eventually being sent to Mimban.[31] Whilst on Mimban, he came to be referred to as \\\"the Beast.\\\"[18] Chewbacca also learned that the Imperials were trying to sell him off as a pit fighter.[32]\\n\\nMeeting Han Solo[]\\n     Chewbacca was kept in filthy conditions on Mimban  \\n\\n\\\"What's your name, anyway?\\\"\\u00abChewbacca, son of Attichitcuk.\\u00bb\\\"All right. Well, you're gonna need a nickname, 'cause I ain't saying that every time.\\\"\\n\\u2015Han Solo and Chewbacca[31]\\nIn 10 BBY, after Han Solo was denounced as a deserter by Tobias Beckett, a criminal impersonating an Imperial officer, his commanding officer decided to execute him by giving him to \\\"the beast.\\\" While imprisoned in an underground holding cell, Han used his knowledge of Shyriiwook to convince Chewbacca to stage a fight with him after realizing that one of the supports in the cell was weak, and that destroying it would allow them to escape imprisonment. Following their escape, the pair managed to join a reluctant gang.[7] Chewbacca, grateful for Solo's intervention, proclaimed a life debt to the outlaw. Chewbacca thereby became Solo's lifelong friend.[33]\\n\\nMeeting Lando Calrissian[]\\n\\n\\\"Oh, come on, Val. He looks so sincere. Plus, have you ever tried to disinvite a Wookiee to anything? Not a good idea.\\\"\\n\\u2015Rio Durant, in response to Val's distrust of Han Solo and Chewbacca[7]\\n     Chewbacca on Vandor, armed with an SX-21 pump-action scatter blaster.  \\nChewbacca and Han began their outlaw lives working as part of pirate Tobias Beckett's crew. The group were hired by Crimson Dawn to steal a train car of refined coaxium on Vandor. However, they failed due to the intervention of Enfys Nest and the Cloud-Riders, and Solo's decision to drop the cargo. Solo and Chewbacca promised Dryden Vos of Crimson Dawn an equivalent shipment that they would obtain unrefined by making the notorious Kessel Run. Vos sent Qi'ra, who had become his top lieutenant, with them.[7]\\nKnowing they would need a fast ship to transport the coaxium before it degraded and exploded, Qi'ra introduced the pair to Lando Calrissian. Solo played Calrissian in a game of \\\"Corellian Spike\\\" sabacc, with the stakes being Calrissian's YT-1300 light freighter, the Millennium Falcon. Solo lost the game, regardless, Calrissian agreed to personally pilot the Falcon for the job in return for a cut of the profits.[7]\\n\\nThe Kessel Run[]\\n\\n\\\"Since when do you know how to fly?\\\"[Chewbacca growls]\\\"190 years old?\\\"[Chewbacca growls]\\\"You look great!\\\"\\n\\u2015Han Solo and Chewbacca[7]\\nChewbacca, Solo, Qi'ra, Calrissian, and Beckett stole the unrefined coaxium from Kessel during a slave riot instigated by Calrissian's navigational droid, L3-37. During the escape, Solo flew the Falcon, with Chewbacca as his copilot, for the first of many times. Because the crew stole the coaxium fuel as unrefined, it was necessary to make the escape from Kessel to the refinery on Savareen in record time, prompting Solo to plot a shorter, and much more dangerous course through the maelstrom that surrounded Kessel and near a gravity well called the Maw, reducing the typical distance required from 20 to 12 parsecs.[7]\\n\\nSavareen[]\\n\\n\\\"Big stuff, you're coming with me.\\\"\\n\\u2015Tobias Beckett commandeers Chewbacca[7]\\n     Beckett takes Chewbacca captive.  \\nUpon reaching Savareen and refining the coaxium, the crew was confronted by Enfys Nest, who explained to them that the Cloud-Riders were freedom fighters stirred to action by the atrocities committed by Crimson Dawn and other crime syndicates, not pirates. Solo devised a plan to give the coaxium to the Cloud-Riders and give Vos fake coaxium, but Vos was prepared for their betrayal because of information given to him by his double-agent in the crew, Beckett.[7]\\nHowever, Solo had double-crossed Beckett and Vos: the containers he left with the Cloud-Raiders were empty, and Nest dispatched the agents Vos sent to retrieve it. The coaxium Solo, Qi'ra, and Chewbacca brought to Vos was, in fact, genuine. Beckett managed to escape with the coaxium and Chewbacca as a hostage. After Qi'ra betrayed and killed Vos, Solo found and killed Beckett, but could only watch as he and Chewbacca were left behind, while Qi'ra left Savareen in Vos' yacht to meet Crimson Dawn leader Maul. Solo and Chewbacca entrusted the coaxium to Nest, who intended to use it to form a rebellion against the Empire.[7]\\n\\nThe Falcon[]\\n     Chewbacca and Han in their newly won Millennium Falcon.  \\nSolo and Chewbacca tracked down Calrissian to Numidian Prime.[32] Solo swiped the spare cards Lando held up his sleeve, and challenged him to a rematch of sabacc for the Falcon, a game which Solo won fairly.[7] The Falcon instantly became Solo's most prized possession. With their new-found ship and confidence, Solo and Chewbacca began engaging in much more dangerous and risky criminal operations, eventually becoming smugglers.[34] Around the same time, Chewbacca likewise hung a pair of chance cube dice above the freighter's piloting console.[19]\\nWith the Falcon as their ship, the two smugglers took on many jobs over the ensuring years.[34] They also came to meet the Tonnika sisters, though their relationship with the siblings soured over the course of their work together,[35] and fellow smuggler Dash Rendar. At some point, Chewbacca also told Tivoche Bilure about what happened to Kashyyyk after the Clone Wars.[36]\\n\\nThe Cordaxian Sea[]\\n\\n\\\"We light enough now, fuzzball?!\\\"\\n\\u2015Han to Chewbacca, after the latter dumps Frax out of the Falcon[37]\\nAt one point, Han Solo and Chewbacca were transporting two tons of Cordaxian ore on Odona, with the help of Frax, a Kajain'sa'Nikto. They were being pursued by the Empire, and Frax, who was worried about being put in an Imperial prison, pulled a blaster on Han. Chewbacca did a barrel roll with the Millennium Falcon, knocking Frax out of the ship entirely. They successfully escaped the Empire and Odona, but left Frax behind.[37]\\n\\nBounty hunted[]\\nDropping Jabba's cargo[]\\nSolo and Chewbacca were later smuggling some Imperial cargo for Jabba the Hutt when they were stopped by an Imperial blockade. They started being chased by several TIE fighters, and they were faced with a choice: surrender, or drop the Imperial cargo. Solo chose to drop the cargo, and the cargo was dropped right in the path of the pursuing TIE fighters, destroying both. Without being pursued, Solo and Chewbacca flew down to the nearby planet, the Falcon heavily damaged.[38]\\n\\nMaking repairs[]\\nOnce landing, they began making repairs, until they found out that the planet was inhabited by the crime lord Nodo. Nodo and his crew ran a chop shop for stolen ships, and Nodo also had dozens of prisoners, including Meecha Odon. Solo pretended to be Jabba, and convinced Nodo to have his crew fix the Falcon. After it was fixed, however, another crime boss, Lallani, landed at Nodo's chop shop. Lallani had heard Jabba was there, and wanted to capture him.[38]\\n\\nFreeing the prisoners[]\\nA battle broke loose, and in the chaos, Solo and Chewbacca freed Odon and the other prisoners. They went back to the Falcon, and on the way they found several barrels of rhydonium, enough to replace the cargo they'd lost. However, Chewbacca convinced Solo that Odon and the prisoners needed the fuel more, and Solo relented. They gave up the fuel they desperately needed, so that Odon could use the fuel to pay for her and the other prisoners' way home.[38]\\n\\nVersus the Mist Hunter[]\\n     Chewbacca fighting Zuckuss  \\nIn 9 BBY,[39] as they were unloading the rhydonium from the Falcon at Valtos space port, Zuckuss and 4-LOM attacked them. They revealed that Han and Chewbacca had a bounty on their head, put there by Nodo himself. Zuckuss managed to put Han into the Mist Hunter's hold, but Chewbacca attacked Zuckuss in order to rescue Solo and Beris Ford, Zuckuss's other prisoner, from the bounty hunters. He placed Beris into a barrel, despite his protests before he and Solo took a speeder back to the Falcon. However, Zuckuss and 4-LOM caught up with, but Chewbacca and Solo were able to use several barrels to knock them down. As they flew Falcon away from Valtos, Chewbacca and Solo ejected Beris' barrel into space with a homing beacon to notify his family. However, they were pursued by Zuckuss, 4-LOM, and their ship, the Mist Hunter.[40]\\nChewbacca manned one of the Falcon's laser cannons to fight off the Mist Hunter. Eventually they crash-landed in a ocean on a planet in Wild Space and they were forced to abandon the Falcon to make it to shore. After the Mist Hunter crashed, Chewbacca and Han then Zuckuss behind. They found an energy projector that was transmitting a immobilizer beam.[41]\\n\\nWorking together[]\\nSolo and Chewbacca climbed the projector, but were confronted by Zuckuss who tossed spears at them. When Chewbacca go to the top, he was able to turn off the beam by destroying it's power source. However, small droids were activated and wanted to destroy them and all organic life in the galaxy.[41]\\nThe two opposing sides decided that it would be best to work together to escape the droids, and they escaped to the Falcon. Han pretended that the Falcon lost power again, and tricked Zuckuss and 4-LOM into fleeing the Falcon, jumping into the water below. Solo and Chewbacca left the planet, leaving the two bounty hunters behind.[42]\\n\\nMission to Ushruu[]\\nFalse pretenses[]\\nAt one point, while on Coruscant after a smuggling job, Chewbacca and Solo were approached by Alinka Aloo, the daughter of Sim Aloo. Aloo, wanted to hire them for a job, and requested that they go to her tower. A week later, they went to see her, and she told them that she had a tooka-sitting job for Chewbacca, and Solo was to remain with her. They reluctantly accepted, and Chewbacca went on a cargo ship with the librarian Mayvlin Trillick. But the ship, on autopilot, pulled them into hyperspace. During the unwilling flight, Chewbacca and Trillick were told by Aloo that the real job was to steal an unknown artifact from a temple on the planet Ushruu. Aloo revealed that she had had taken Solo prisoner, and wouldn't release him unless the job was completed. With no choice but to continue, Chewbaccca continued the job, along with Trillick. Before the ship reached Ushruu, the two bonded, as Trillick told Chewbacca about how her planet had been ravaged by the Empire, and she was also being blackmailed by Aloo, who had one of her peoples' sacred texts. The two dealt with the tookas and the cargo ship's cargo droid, K-2SB, who was actually K-2SO on an undercover mission for Cassian Andor. Eventually, the ship pulled out of hyperspace.[43]\\n\\nAcquiring the artifact[]\\nWhen they found a place to land, they found dead Trandoshans, sent to find the artifact by Janus Greejatus. Trillick and Chewbacca proceeded to travel towards the location of the temple, bringing K-2SO along. Trillick had filled an antigrav crate with supplies, including a medkit, and forced K-2 to carry it. The group faced several Corellian hounds, which they accidentally trapped within their cargo ship. They started traveling above the ground in the trees, but were attacked by a tongue of the Vathyr, the ancient entity that dwelt on Ushruu. It dragged Trillick to the Vathyr itself, but Chewbacca managed to free her. Eventually, they reached the temple, and searched it. They found the artifact, which was an ancient book of dark side teachings, in the temple's library. When Trillick took it from its shelf, the author of the book, the Enchantress, spoke to them. The Enchantress's voice asked who the book was for, and seemed satisfied when she was told it was for Emperor Palpatine.[43]\\n\\nSaving Han[]\\nK-2SO stored the book in his chest compartment as they traveled back to the cargo ship. But when they reached the ship, Andor had arrived. Cassian and K-2 flew away with the book, which Chewbacca and Trillick needed to rescue Solo and the ancient text. Chewbacca came up with a plan, and he and Trillick flew back to Coruscant. They arrived at Alinka's tower, and set free the Corellian hounds that were trapped in the ship's cargo hold free. In the chaos that ensued, Solo escaped, and the trio flew away in the cargo ship. They went back to the Falcon, and fought many TIE fighters to escape Coruscant. Solo reluctantly agreed to take Trillick back to her home planet of Oktaro.[43]\\n\\nGalactic Civil War[]\\nDeath Star rescue[]\\n\\n\\u00abIt's okay to care about them.

Arriving at Mos Eisley on Tatooine to speak with Jabba about the lost cargo, they sat down in Chalmun's Spaceport Cantina. At the bar, Chewbacca was approached by Ben Kenobi, who was searching for passage for himself, Luke Skywalker and the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO to Alderaan. Promised 2,000 credits in advance and an additional 15,000 upon arrival to Alderaan, Solo and Chewbacca agreed to the commission.[3]\\nIn Docking Bay 94, Solo and Chewbacca found Jabba waiting for them with a crew of hired help.[44] One of them, the famous bounty hunter Boba Fett, kept an eye on Chewbacca, noting the Wookiee getting ready for a fight as Solo spoke with Jabba. Thus, he moved his arm enough to ensure the Wookiee braids he wore were visible to Chewbacca, which the Wookiee decided to show no reaction to.[44] Ultimately, Solo managed to convince Jabba to give him more time. After a brief firefight with stormtroopers, the Falcon left Tatooine with its new passengers, escaping from Imperial vessels before entering hyperspace.[3]\\nDuring the hyperspace journey, while Kenobi trained Skywalker in the use of the Force, Chewbacca played a game of dejarik with R2-D2, who made a move that Chewbacca disliked. C-3PO advised that the move was technically fair, and even chided Chewbacca, at which point Solo advised them not to anger the Wookiee because of his species' tendency to pull arms out of their sockets, prompting the two droids to surrender.[3]\\n\\n     Chewbacca, pretending to be an Imperial prisoner.  \\nUpon the Falcon's exit from hyperspace, the group found themselves in a meteor storm produced by the destruction of the planet by the Imperial Death Star superweapon. The group were soon caught by the tractor beam of the battle station which was still looming in the system, but managed to evade capture by hiding in the Falcon's smuggling compartments. While Kenobi set out to disable the station's tractor beam in order to allow them to escape, Skywalker was told by R2-D2 that Princess Leia Organa was being held in Detention Block AA-23, her execution scheduled. They set out to rescue her, with Chewbacca posing as a prisoner of stormtrooper-disguised Skywalker and Solo. Despite encountering trouble, Chewbacca and the others managed to escape from the Death Star\\u2014except for Kenobi, who had died in a duel with Darth Vader. The Falcon soon arrived to Yavin 4, landing on Rebellion's secret base, just as the Death Star closed in on the moon.[3]\\n\\nYavin 4[]\\n\\n\\\"What're you looking at? I know what I'm doing.\\\"\\n\\u2015Han Solo to Chewbacca[3]\\nSkywalker was hopeful that Chewbacca and Solo would join the Rebellion, but Solo was more concerned with receiving his payment in order to pay his debt to Jabba. Though Chewbacca growled in dissatisfaction at this course of action, the two departed, seemingly leaving the Rebel Alliance on its own to deal with the Death Star.[3] At Chewbacca's urging, with Solo also feeling that he needed to help Skywalker,[45] they would return just in time to protect Skywalker during the Battle of Yavin from Vader's TIE Advanced x1, allowing the young pilot to destroy the massive battle station by firing a proton torpedo into its exhaust port.[3]\\n\\n     Chewbacca lets out a triumphant howl after Skywalker and Solo are awarded medals.  \\nBack on Yavin 4, Luke Skywalker and Han Solo were both awarded medals by Organa, while Chewbacca howled in delight during the ceremony.[3] The time for celebration was soon over, for Organa asked the Rebels to take a moment of silence to honor and remember all those who had died when Alderaan was destroyed, whereas General Dodonna announced their need to evacuate Yavin since the Empire was aware of their location.[46] Chewbacca would be also awarded a medal,[19][8] and shared a moment of banter between Organa and Solo, just before they parted ways.[46]\\n\\nCyrkon[]\\n\\n\\\"You two play fast and loose.\\\"\\\"It's worked so far.\\\"\\n\\u2015Caluan Ematt, on Chewbacca and Han Solo's tactics[19]\\nHowever, before they could depart for Tatooine to pay Jabba, Organa would ask Solo to run an errand for the Rebellion, which Chewbacca convinced him to accept\\u2014to rescue Lieutenant Caluan Ematt from Cyrkon. On the Falcon, the two made their way to the planet, only to find themselves confronted by the Vehement, which they avoided with a false IFF transponder, and landed in Motok. There, they were immediately attacked by some of Jabba's bounty hunters, including Captivator, which prompted Solo to accuse them of being \\\"Rebels\\\" and set them against ISB Commander Alecia Beck's garrison.[19]\\nChewbacca slipped away with Solo to the Miss Fortune cantina, where they found their old friend Delia Leighton, to whom they asked about Ematt's location. After she told them their destination and the password, Chewbacca and Solo rented a V-40 and went into a hotel, where they met Ematt, but were attacked by the bounty hunters again, as Leighton had revealed their location to save Curtis's life. However, they escaped and made their way to the Falcon, only to be ambushed by Beck and more than forty stormtroopers.[19]\\n\\n     Chewbacca, Solo and Ematt confronted by Alecia Beck.  \\nForced to surrender, Chewbacca, Solo and Ematt were taken into custody, with Beck focusing on Ematt and leaving Chewbacca and Solo to the stormtroopers. Unbeknownst to the Imperials, Solo noticed the Miss Fortune making their way to save them, but with the magnetic field activated, it would be pointless. Once aware of Solo's intentions, Chewbacca pretended to be angry at Solo and shoved him, sending him flying into a trooper to grab his E-11 medium blaster rifle and destroy the field generators, flooding the hangar with Cyrkon's toxic gases. Soon enough, the Miss Fortune opened fire at the Imperials, and Chewbacca made his way to the Falcon to start the engines while Solo helped Ematt and recovered their weapons.[19]\\nSoon in Cyrkon's orbit along with the Miss Fortune, they found themselves against the Vehement and eight TIE fighters. They engaged the starfighters, defeating several of them, until the Miss Fortune's took a hit that damaged its navicomputer; Chewbacca saw Solo's nobler side when he decided to cover the 1550-LEX space yacht to make a run for Cyrkon's atmosphere just as the Vehement's tractor beam advanced towards them. They resisted the beam by entering the planet's atmosphere themselves, while Leighton fled, and approached Motok in a dead-engine glide, daring Beck into catching the Falcon at the price of destroying the city with the tractor beam and turning Cyrkon against the Empire. As she desisted, the Falcon began its fall to the ground and the two pilots manually restarted the engines, just in time to avoid crashing into the city and escape.[19]\\n\\nAndelm IV[]\\nSometime later, he was on an important solo mission to deliver a box, when the flight stabilizer of his ship malfunctioned. Forced to crash-land on Andelm IV, Chewbacca went to a city to obtain a replacement and engaged a Besalisk vendor. Their deal was interrupted by a fugitive young girl, Zarro, who tried to sell her stolen speeder bike. The Besalisk, however, refused and tried to betray her to the planet's crime lord, Jaum. Chewbacca stopped him, though, by having the Besalisk sell him the stabilizer. However, he did not have enough credits to buy it. Subsequently, he went to a cantina and played sabacc, successfully doubling his credits. Chewbacca then noticed the girl from before, and helped her hide from Jaum's men.[47]\\nAfterwards, Zarro followed him as he bought the stabilizer and tried to convince into helping her save her father and friends. Unable to delay his mission, Chewbacca repaired his ship, and changed his mind to leave the planet when Zarro mentioned her people had been enslaved by Jaum. Unknown to Chewbacca and Zarro, Jaum was planning to export the Andelm beetle larvae to the Empire to be processed into Dedlanite, a substance used in the manufacture of blasters.[47] To maximise profits, Jaum also planned to sell his slave workforce to the Empire.[30]\\nThe following day, Zarro devised a plan to infiltrate Jaum's mine. She got Chewbacca to search for an open air vent for the slave miners to escape. Meanwhile, Zarro infiltrated the mine by allowing herself to be recaptured. Her plan was to locate a hollowed part of the mine. Keeping in touch by transmitter, Zarro told Chewbacca to find an open air vent. While struggling through the tunnel, the Wookiee was haunted by memories of his enslavement at the hands of the Trandoshans. Zarro's escape plan encountered a problem when she was caught by Jaum and his men. After the miners including Zarro's father Arrax objected to Jaum's plan, the gangster ordered his men to execute the miners.[30]\\nBefore Jaum's guards could carry out their execution, Chewbacca snuck up behind them and overpowered them with his bowcaster. After meeting Zarro's father, Chewbacca joined forces with the miners to fight their way out of the mine. He refashioned a rod from a broken-down GNK-series power droid and used it to disable a wheeled battle droid. Shortly later, the Wookiee knocked out one of Jaum's henchmen with the derelict GNK power droid. Chewbacca eventually found his way to the mine's loading bay, which was full of crates of Andelm beetle larvae. However, Jaum's Shistavanen enforcer Tyvak fired on the incendiary larvae with his blaster, igniting an explosion that created a cave-in.[30]\\nDespite Tyvak's efforts, Chewbacca and his friends managed to survive the explosion. Part of the Wookiee's left leg was scorched by fire but Zarro managed to douse it. Chewbacca and his friends then narrowly escaped a swarm of Andelm beetles. Chewbacca managed to used his bowcaster to collapse a girder, temporarily delaying the swarm but denying the miners their only way out in the process. While heading to regroup with the other miners in a different section of the mine, Chewbacca encountered the guard he had knocked out with the GNK power droid. Upon recognizing the guard, he dropped the heavy droid chassis on the man, leaving him behind.[48]\\nWhile the miners discussed a way of digging themselves out of the mine, Chewbacca came up with the idea of climbing out vertically through a sinkhole. While skeptical of the Wookiee's chance of success, the miners and Zarro agreed to support his plan. With much effort, Chewbacca managed to climb through the roots of a dead tree and topple it, creating a pit large enough for all the miners to climb up. Chewbacca then lowered a rope for all the miners to evacuate. Once everyone had reached the surface, Chewbacca and Zarro departed under the pretext of repairing his A-wing starfighter.[48]\\nIn truth, Zarro was planning to stop Jaum and the Empire from taking over Andelm IV. Enlisting Chewbacca's support, they traveled to the planet's spaceport. There, they found a bunker that was inhabited by her blind friend Sevox and his protocol droid I-7, who served as the \\\"eyes\\\" of the former. After examining Sevox's junkshop, Chewbacca came up with a plan to sabotage Jaum's plot to export Dedlanite to the Empire.[48] this plan involved fitting a decrepit R5 repair droid with explosives. Sevox thought Chewbacca and Zarro's plan had little chance of success but nonetheless agreed to drop them off at the spaceport. He also offered his bunker as a hiding place for Zarro and her friend.[49]\\nAfter shooing away a group of child beggars, Chewbacca and Jaum infiltrated the spaceport disguised as Jaum's new war droid and a hooded alien. They soon discovered that the spaceport was being occupied by several stormtroopers, Scout troopers, and an AT-ST walker. Shortly later, they found Jaum supervising several stormtroopers who were loading crates of dedlanite into an Imperial landing craft. When Jaum demanded that Zarro take off her helmet, Chewbacca opened fire on the gangster and his stormtroopers. After running out of ammunition, he took out the stormtroopers in hand to hand combat.[49]\\nWhile Chewbacca exchanged fire with Jaum, Zarro managed to bring the rigged R5 droid \\\"Boomer\\\" aboard the shuttle. Chewbacca then fought with Tyvak but was trapped by the AT-ST walker. The Wookiee however activated a nearby engine which burned Tyvak alive and knocked out the Imperial walker's right cannon, causing it to topple to the ground. Meanwhile, Jaum managed to escape aboard the landing craft with the dedlanite and \\\"Boomer.\\\" The two were overjoyed their plot had succeeded. However, their elation was short-lived and they were soon arrested by scout troopers reporting to the Imperial Commander Kai, the same officer who was interested in Jaum's dedlanite deal.[49]\\nPer Commander Kai's orders, Chewbacca and Zarro were transported up to Kai's Imperial Star Destroyer in orbit above Andelm IV. On the way up, Chewbacca and Zarro managed to overpower their stormtrooper captors aboard the Imperial shuttle. After landing, Chewbacca knocked out an Imperial RA-7 protocol droid that Kai had sent to negotiate their surrender. After knocking out the remaining stormtroopers clinging to his body, Kai agreed to listen to Zarro.[50]\\nZarro made up a story that Jaum was a fraudster who had come to scam Kai. She also claimed that he was a rebel spy and that he did not have a mining operation. To back up her story, Zarro told him that Jaum's \\\"droid\\\" \\\"Boomer\\\" was rigged with explosives. Shortly later, Jaum arrived carrying samples of dedlanite. Shortly later, Boomer exploded, destroying the landing craft and damaging the Star Destroyer's force-field. In the meantime, Chewbacca and Zarro managed to escape on a TIE/sa bomber. Despite Zarro accidentally activating a thermal detonator which destroyed the ship's left-wing, they managed to crash-land the bomber on Andelm IV.[50]\\nWhile Chewbacca turned down Zarro's request to stay behind with her people, he still gave her a hug and awarded her a gold medallion he had received for his services during the Battle of Yavin. After departing as friends, Chewbacca traveled on his A-wing to his homeworld of Kashyyyk. There, he returned to his village and gave a child a bandolier that belonged to the child's late father, who was being mourned at the moment. Shortly later, Chewbacca departed aboard the Millennium Falcon. Meanwhile, Jaum was imprisoned by Commander Kai, who was disgusted by Jaum's greed and his alleged scam. He had the gangster tortured by his IT-O Interrogator.[50]\\n\\nCymoon 1[]\\n\\n\\\"Chewie, stand down! Do not fire! You take a shot at Darth Vader and the whole factory will be on alert!\\\"\\\"Are you crazy? Chewbacca if you have a shot at Vader I order you to take it! Forget about us! Killing him is more important! Do you hear me Chewie? Take the shot! Now!\\\"\\n\\u2015Han Solo and Princess Leia Organa[11]\\n     Chewbacca watches the team from the vantage point.  \\nChewbacca took part in an assault on Weapons Factory Alpha, on the moon Cymoon 1, alongside the usual team\\u2014Solo, Organa, Skywalker, C-3PO and R2-D2\\u2014, with Solo posing as the envoy of Jabba the Hutt to enter the factory, Skywalker and Organa disguised as his bodyguards, along with R2-D2. Separately, Chewbacca and C-3PO landed the Falcon in the refuse fields surrounding the factory, with the latter going to a vantage point to observe through the scope of his sniper rifle how Solo engaged Overseer Aggadeen and entered the facilities.[11]\\nUnexpectedly, though, Darth Vader arrived on a Lambda-class T-4a shuttle, and Chewbacca contacted Solo, telling him to stand down, for firing on the Sith Lord would put the entire moon on alert, but Organa gave the order to take the shot. Chewbacca consented and fired, but Vader sensed danger and deflected the first shot with his lightsaber. He continued shooting, but the Sith Lord had lifted two stormtroopers into the air using the Force and used them as human shields, only for him to topple the building Chewbacca was perched upon. Though it collapsed, the Wookiee escaped from the wreckage. Now being hunted down, Chewbacca lost contact with the team as he made his way to the Falcon.[11]\\n\\n     Chewbacca unleashes his rage against the intruding aliens.  \\nWhen he arrived, he discovered C-3PO in pieces strapped and the freighter being dismantled by tentacled aliens. Angered, Chewbacca chased the scavenger away, recovered the protocol droid and made contact with Solo, who along Organa had hijacked an AT-AT and were escaping from Vader. Despite the lengthy time he needed to fix the ship, Chewbacca repaired enough of the Falcon's damage to pilot it to the team's position, where he extracted them and many of the slaves Skywalker had freed. As they began their retreat from Cymoon 1, Organa took over the controls instead of a delirious Solo, so that Chewbacca could repair the hyperdrive, which he managed to do, so that Organa could make the jump into lightspeed and escape a blockade of Star Destroyers.[51]\\n\\nNar Shaddaa[]\\n\\n\\\"The mighty Chewbacca. I must say\\u2026I expected better. You hear so much about the big, scary Wookiees. But you're really not so tough after all, are y\\u2014\\\"\\n\\u2015Dengar underestimates Chewbacca[52]\\nWithin two days, the Millennium Falcon rendezvoused with the Alliance Fleet, where Solo was treated for his injuries and Chewbacca and Solo went on to better repair the Falcon on an Alliance Nebulon-B frigate, when the Corellian noted that it had been a miracle that the ship had flown with Chewbacca's rushed repairs, prompting an annoyed reply from the Wookiee, while they strived to repair the Falcon.[53]\\nThe need for new parts prompted Solo to go on a mission with Organa, leaving Chewbacca behind with the freighter.[54] However, when he heard that Skywalker had been captured by Grakkus the Hutt on Nar Shaddaa, he volunteered for the rescue mission before Chancellor Mon Mothma, and Generals Dodonna and Gial Ackbar of the Alliance High Command. Taking C-3PO with him,[55] Chewbacca took the Falcon to the moon, wherein the droid did the talking, and the Wookiee used more violent means to interrogate the criminals in search of Skywalker. It was a Zabrak bartender who told them of Skywalker's location on Grakkus's palace and his direction, and Chewbacca and C-3PO set out to Skywalker's encounter.[56] Just as Chewbacca and C-3PO were planning to break into Grakkus's palace, they were attacked by Dengar. Chewbacca fought Dengar until Solo and Organa arrived, and Solo shot Dengar in the back.[52] With Dengar distracted by Solo, Chewbacca used the opportunity to throw Dengar off the building. Chewbacca, Solo, and Organa then went to save Luke from Grakkus, only to find several stormtroopers in the way. R2-D2 acquired a few lightsabers from Grakkus, and they used them to fight the enemies. After that, they fled Nar Shaddaa.[57]\\n\\nVrogas Vas[]\\n\\n\\\"The smuggler Han Solo has an associate. Or a pet, I'm not sure.

Chew\\u2026bacca?\\\"\\\"RRRRRRWWWWWGGHHHHH!\\\"\\n\\u20150-0-0, Doctor Aphra, and Chewbacca[58]\\nLater, when Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader crash-landed on Vrogas Vas, Organa approached Solo and Chewbacca for help in defeating Vader and saving Luke.[59] While Han Solo faced off against Doctor Chelli Aphra, Chewbacca ripped the arms off of Triple-Zero, a homicidal protocol droid. But Triple-0 managed to inject a lethal dose of Mandalorian xenotox into Chewbacca, leveling the playing field. But before Triple-0 could kill Chewbacca, Luke came to the rescue, further damaging Triple-Zero. Chewbacca, Luke, Han Solo, and R2-D2 then all fled from BT-1, a homicidal astromech droid.[60] As they all went to save Leia from Vader, they were attacked by Krrsantan, who was working alongside Aphra. Even though he was feeling the effects of Triple-Zero's poison, Chewbacca started fighting Krrsantan.[61] Chewbacca was initially losing the fight, but when R2-D2 injected him with the antidote to the poison, Chewbacca started winning the fight.[62] However, Krrsantan was defeated when he attacked C-3PO, who electrocuted Krrsantan. When they returned to the Falcon, they were able to capture Aphra.[63]\\n\\nThe Harbinger[]\\nLater, Chewbacca assisted the rebellion in commandeering the Star Destroyer Harbinger.[64] Chewbacca jettisoned the ship's reactor just before it exploded, creating the illusion that the ship was destroyed. He, along with many other Rebels, worked on keeping the ship afloat while flying it towards Tureen VII.[65] When Task Force 99 infiltrated the Harbinger to stop them from breaking the Empire's blockade of Tureen VII, Chewbacca fought one of the elite stormtroopers, Zuke.[66] Since the fight took place in the engine room, Chewbacca was able to throw Zuke into the engine's machinery, which brought the engine back to full power. When the Rebels broke the Imperial siege above Tureen VII, they all fled except for C-3PO, who was captured by SCAR Squadron.[67]\\n\\nSkorii-Lei[]\\nAt some point, Organa was nearly captured by the Empire while transporting important information on Skorii-Lei, but escaped with the help of an inhabitant of the planet named Pash Davane. Solo, Skywalker, and Chewbacca helped the two escape in the Millennium Falcon.[68]\\n\\nThe Screaming Citadel[]\\n\\n\\\"Hrrrrrrgggh!\\\"\\\"I know, Chewie, and I'm sorry. But if Sana is right and Luke's on Ktath'atn, we can't risk bringing a Wookiee with us.\\\"\\n\\u2015Chewbacca and Han Solo[69]\\nWhen Skywalker left with Aphra for the Screaming Citadel, and Solo, Organa, and Starros were preparing to go rescue him, Chewbacca attempted to go with them, but wasn't allowed, because the people of Ktath'atn were extremely hostile towards Wookiees.[69]\\n\\nThe Hutt Run[]\\nLater, Solo was asked by Mothma to transport Grakkus to a Rebel holding facility in the catacombs of Akiva. During the trip, Solo and Chewbacca were attacked by several TIE fighters. Chewbacca manned the Millennium Falcon's turret while Solo flew, but they had to give up and land on a nearby asteroid, since the Falcon's hyperdrive was damaged. Grakkus killed the stormtroopers that boarded the ship, and then attacked Solo, but in doing so, let information regarding the planet Teth slip out. Solo electrocuted Grakkus, and they continued on to Akiva.[70]\\n\\nOdona[]\\nAt one point, Solo and Organa were on Odona looking for a new spot for a Rebel base. They were attacked by Frax, and Organa was grazed by a blaster bolt. Chewbacca helped her into the Falcon, and they fled.[37]\\n\\nHoth[]\\n\\n\\\"Laugh it up, fuzzball!\\\"\\n\\u2015Han Solo, in response to Chewbacca laughing at him\\u00a0\\u2014  Listen (file info)[71]\\n     Chewbacca captured by a wampa.  \\nNow full-fledged members of the Rebel Alliance, and following a dangerous run-in with bounty hunter on Ord Mantell, Chewbacca accompanied Solo to Hoth, for they had been assigned to the newly-established Echo Base, where Chewbacca would be effecting repairs on the Millennium Falcon to pay their debt to Jabba once and for all.[71]\\nWhile at Echo Base, Chewbacca was assigned to digging corridors by Organa. On one of these assignments, Chewbacca dug into a cave occupied by a wampa. The beast captured him and held him hostage. After not checking in, Leia and Artoo started looking for him. They found a scared Chewbacca clutched in the hands of the sleeping wampa. Organa's attempted rescue of Chewbacca ended with the wampa waking up. The wookiee ran to repair the door, which led to the uncovered cave with Artoo, while Leia acted as a distraction. At the last minute, Chewbacca finished his job on the door, and with Organa back inside, he closed it and trapped the woken beast in the cave.[72]\\n\\n     Chewbacca while on Hoth.  \\nChewbacca's repairs on the Falcon were when Solo had to venture outside during Hoth's night to rescue Skywalker. Soon afterwards, Chewbacca and Solo destroyed an Imperial probe droid, but could not prevent it from transmitting information back to the Empire, revealing the location of the hidden Rebel base. The Empire consequently launched an all-out assault on the planet, forcing Chewbacca, Solo, Organa and C-3PO to flee on the Millennium Falcon.[71]\\nHowever, with the Falcon's damaged hyperdrive, they were unable to leave the system and escape the Imperial blockade, which prompted Solo to pilot the ship into a nearby asteroid field, hoping that the Imperials would be unwilling to follow them there. Evading several pursuing TIE fighters, they landed the ship inside a cave of a large asteroid, where they hoped to hide from Imperial forces and complete repairs. While waiting inside the cavern, Chewbacca continued to repair the freighter until mynocks attacked it; soon, they realized the cave was in fact the inside of a space slug, forcing them to flee. The Falcon was subsequently attacked by the Imperial Star Destroyer Avenger, but with a maneuver devised by Solo, they were able to avoid the vessel and fled to Cloud City on the gas giant Bespin, where they would request help from Calrissian, an old acquaintance of Han's. Unbeknownst to them, they were followed by the bounty hunter Boba Fett.[71]\\n\\nCloud City[]\\n\\n\\\"Chewie, this won't help me! Hey! Save your strength, there'll be another time! The princess\\u2014you have to take care of her! Do ya hear me, huh?\\\"\\n\\u2015Han Solo\\u00a0\\u2014  Listen (file info)[71]\\n     Chewbacca worked to reassemble C-3PO while imprisoned.  \\nUpon arrival to Cloud City, the group was welcomed by Calrissian, and spent a few days until the Falcon was repaired. However, they grew increasingly suspicious, especially after C-3PO disappeared. Chewbacca took on the task of finding the missing protocol droid, eventually rescuing him from a junk pile. After a scuffle with some Ugnaught workers, he brought the droid back to Organa and Solo, when Calrissian invited them to enjoy some refreshments. In truth, it was a meeting with Darth Vader, who had arrived to Cloud City before the Rebel team did and forced Calrissian into a deal to have them imprisoned.[71]\\nSeparated from the others, Chewbacca began to partially reassemble C-3PO, when Solo was escorted back by stormtroopers, having been tortured by Vader, with Organa. They were eventually brought to Calrissian's carbon-freezing facilities where Solo was to be frozen in carbonite to test it before Skywalker arrived, for Vader desired to encase Skywalker in carbonite and present him to the Emperor. Though Chewbacca tried to fight, wanting to protect his old friend, Solo calmed him down, asking him to save his strength for another day. The Wookiee then relented and allowed himself to be placed in stuncuffs as Solo was marched off and frozen.[71]\\n\\n     Chewbacca chokes Lando Calrissian for betraying the group.  \\nAs Chewbacca and Organa being escorted to Vader's ship, Calrissian, who was growing increasingly dissatisfied with Vader's deal, betrayed the Sith Lord and freed the two. Chewbacca, though, was not quick to trust him and reacted violently, choking him. The princess was able to calm him enough for Calrissian to inform them that Boba Fett was about to leave Cloud City carrying the carbonite-frozen Solo. Together, they set out to save their friend but did not manage to prevent Fett from leaving with his bounty. The team then boarded the Falcon to escape the city, briefly returning to save Skywalker, who had fought and lost a duel on Cloud City with the Sith Lord.[71]\\n\\nRendezvous Point Delta-Three[]\\n\\n\\\"Anyway, yeah, eight missiles, that'll pack a punch. But even if they all land, they won't take out a Star Destroyer.\\\"\\\"HROOAH!\\\"\\\"Master Chewbacca suggests that we do not actually need to destroy an entire vessel, merely the gun emplacements on one of the light cruisers. If this succeeds, the integrity of the cordon will be reduced, and\\u2014\\\"\\\"I understand Shyriiwook, Goldie. I get the idea. Doesn't mean it ain't crazy.\\\"\\n\\u2015Lando Calrissian, Chewbacca, and C-3PO[73]\\nAfter escaping the Empire, Chewbacca argued with Calrissian about pursuing Solo. The former Baron Administrator refuted Chewbacca\\u2019s plan, citing Fett\\u2019s involvement, causing the Wookiee to become angry. Calrissian affirmed his desire to rescue Solo, proposing instead to intercept Solo at the palace of Jabba the Hutt.[73]\\nOrgana, accepting that Solo could not immediately be saved, ordered Chewbacca to set course for the Rebel fleet, overriding Calrissian\\u2019s objections and again issuing her companion the command. The Wookiee complied, leading Organa and company to discover rebels under attack by Imperial forces at Rendezvous Point Delta-Three. The princess instructed Chewbacca to create a hole in the blockade before taking to the Falcon's guns, Calrissian persuaded the Wookiee to reluctantly allow him to take the pilot\\u2019s seat.[73]\\nCalrissian, questioning the Falcon's ability to contribute, led Chewbacca to reveal the starship\\u2019s ST2 missile launchers which, while effective, could not incapacitate a Star Destroyer. The Wookiee, translated by C-3PO, suggested that they need not destroy an entire ship, just cripple its gun emplacements. Calrissian, acknowledging the plan as crazy, noted a belief that time spent with Solo had made Chewbacca far less rational. Skywalker and Organa destroyed a number of TIE fighters, allowing Calrissian and Chewbacca to make a successful attack run.[73]\\n\\nReturn to Tatooine[]\\n\\n\\\"Tatooine. Been a long time since I saw this hellhole.\\\"\\\"HRROK!\\\"\\\"You said it, pal. Not long enough.\\\"\\n\\u2015Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca[74]\\nThe crew of the Falcon escaped to Backup Rendezvous Point Gamma-Nine, meeting up with the Fourth Division of the Alliance Fleet, where Organa ordered Chewbacca not to let Calrissian out of his sight.[73] Calrissian pressured Organa to allow him to take the Falcon to Tatooine to confirm whether Jabba had Solo. Organa agreed, but insisted Chewbacca accompany him. The Wookiee roared, intimidating Calrissian and causing him to restate his submission. Calrissian told Chewbacca it was \\\"time to fly,\\\" to which the pair agreed the latter would pilot the Falcon this time around.[74] The group subsequently parted ways\\u2014Organa, Skywalker and the droids remained with the fleet, whereas Chewbacca and Calrissian set out to find Fett and Jabba to rescue Solo.[71]\\nIn orbit of Tatooine, Calrissian and the Wookiee reflected on their distaste at returning to the sand planet before being fired upon by a squadron of TIE fighters, the Falcon having been identified as a wanted ship. The pair debated the fault of the matter, and the TIEs were ambushed and destroyed by a group of Weequay, who hailed the ship and demanded Han Solo. Chewbacca\\u2019s first instinct was to fight, but Calrissian, recognizing that they were outmatched, opted for deception. Calrissian cued the Wookiee to power up the Falcon's empty missile tubes and talked his way out of combat and into proceeding to his audience with Jabba.[74]\\nAfter the meeting, Calrissian returned to Chewbacca aboard the Falcon, informing him that Jabba did not yet have Solo. Calrissian requested that Chewbacca drop him off and leave him to his own devices, which the latter refused to do.[74]\\n\\nTarkin's prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9 and Operation Starlight[]\\n\\n\\\"Sounds like you need a new code, princess.

You'd just be handing the Imperials the new code too.\\\"\\n\\u2015Lando Calrissian and Chewbacca[75]\\nChewbacca was later present after Skywalker's return from Tempes for the Jedi's unveiling of his new lightsaber,[76] and at a briefing after an attack on the fleet by Imperial forces led by Ellian Zhara.[77] When Organa revealed the discovery that the Imperials had deciphered the rebels' current encryption codes, Calrissian suggested using another code entirely, leading Chewbacca to voice a concern that whatever new code was used would simply be broken in time as well.[75] The Wookiee was later around when the Autonomous Translator Module, Mark II utilized Lobot's cybernetic implants to communicate with Starlight Squadron, endangering the hybroid.[78]\\nChewbacca later stood alongside Calrissian and their comrades, staring into a bright light as Skywalker reassured Organa that they would recover Solo.[79]\\n\\nReturn to Nar Shaddaa[]\\n\\n\\\"HRAH!

RRRRRHHHH HHHHHNH?\\\"\\\"If you will allow me to translate from Shryiiwook\\u2026Chewbacca has heard from a contact of his on the Smuggler's Moon of Nar Shaddaa.

And since he is in possession of the block of frozen carbonite containing our good friend and rebel hero Han Solo, Chewbacca wants you to\\u2014\\\"\\\"I get it, Threepio. Of course I'll go.\\\"\\n\\u2015Chewbacca, C-3PO, and Luke Skywalker[80]\\nAt some point, Chewbacca put out word of his search for Boba Fett among free Wookiees across the galaxy. The smuggler heard back from Sagwa, a Wookiee he had himself freed from the Spice Mines of Kessel, who reported a sighting of Fett on Nar Shaddaa. Chewbacca subsequently spoke to Skywalker after his lightsaber training in the ship's gym and, with C-3PO translating, requested the Jedi's assistance on a mission to the Smuggler's Moon. Skywalker accepted, though Chewbacca declined his suggestion to bring Calrissian, feeling that Calrissian was untrustworthy and that Solo's reaction to the man would be unpleasant given his betrayal.[80]\\n\\nA familiar smell[]\\n\\n\\\"GHUURRGG.\\\"\\\"Thank you\\u2026but I don't understand Shyriiwook.\\\"\\\"He said if you truly care about Han Solo, you will trust him to save him.

His words, not mine.\\\"\\n\\u2015Chewbacca, Beilert Valance, and C-3PO[81]\\nChewbacca piloted the Falcon to Nar Shaddaa while Skywalker sat in the co-pilot's seat, reflecting on their prior encounter there with Grakkus the Hutt.[80] The Wookiee traveled to Oruba Square alongside C-3PO, where he convened with[81] his contact,[80] a cloaked Mirialan. Chewbacca paid the informant, who then relayed to him that Sagwa would meet his fellow Wookiee at the entrance to the local arena. The Wookiee rebuffed C-3PO's complaints, claiming that Nar Shaddaa was \\\"charming,\\\" not dreadful as the protocol droid has proposed, and reflected on his prior traumatic electrocution on the Smuggler's Moon before catching wind of \\\"a familiar smell.\\\" Chewbacca barged into the crowd before bumping into an old acquaintance\\u2014cyborg bounty hunter Beilert Valance.[81]\\nThe cyborg recognized Chewbacca as Solo's ally, while Chewbacca remembered Valance's participation a shootout against the two smugglers on Abregado-Rae. The Wookiee hoisted Valance off his feet and growled at him, the bounty hunter claiming the situation to be a misunderstanding. Valance's partner, rival bounty hunter Dengar, watched, while C-3PO flustered about Chewbacca's failure to maintain a low profile against Skywalker's orders. Valance punched Chewbacca, refusing to allow anyone to interfere in his own search for Solo, while trying to defuse the situation. The bounty hunter lowered his palm blasters in deference, providing Chewbacca the opportunity to throw him into a table where Dengar had taken a seat and ordered a drink.[81]\\nChewbacca then grabbed Dengar, the very bounty hunter to electrocute the Wookiee on his last outing to the Smuggler's Moon, C-3PO informing him that the species were notorious for holding grudges. Dengar pulled his blaster and attempted to shoot the Chewbacca, despite an attempt at intervention from Valance, who then kicked the Wookiee's legs out from under him and fashioned a sharpened stick out of a nearby pole. Valance spoke to the events of Abregado-Rae, telling Chewbacca that he did not intend to kill them once he realized Solo was the target, throwing down his weapon and reflecting on his time spent with Solo as Imperial cadets. The bounty hunter concluded that he owed Solo a debt and intended to aid him with or without the Wookiee's permission.[81]\\nThe fight at its end, Chewbacca offered Valance a hand up. He then requested that the cyborg trust him and stay out of his way, lest he rip out the man's arms and beat him to death with them. C-3PO translated for the bounty hunter, who did not understand Shyriiwook, before departing with the Wookiee.[81]\\n\\nSkywalker and Sagwa[]\\n\\n\\\"HROOO!\\\"\\\"Chewbacca is reluctant to leave without more information on Boba Fett.\\\"\\\"Chewie, we don't even know if it was Boba Fett. I think\\u2026we might have to find another way to track down Han.\\\"\\\"ARRRGH!\\\"\\n\\u2015Chewbacca, C-3PO, and Luke Skywalker[80]\\nChewbacca met with Sagwa, embracing him as C-3PO explained their history to Skywalker. Sagwa informed Chewbacca that a new champion had risen in the Garkata arena; a larger than life hologram displayed the fighter, whose Mandalorian armor, Skywalker confirmed, indeed resembled Boba Fett, though the figure was operating under the name Jango. Sagwa, who worked a guard at the arena, led the Chewbacca and his allies to there to check its records for clues to \\\"Jango\\\"'s current location. Skywalker bribed and questioned the Pa'lowick attendent, only for them to betray the rebels, summoning a band mercenaries working for the Kanji Criminal Enterprise.[80]\\nSkywalker drew his lightsaber and attempted to talk his way past the criminals, culminating in a fight. Chewbacca joined in the confrontation with his bowcaster, but the group became overwhelmed, leading the Jedi to suggest a retreat. The Wookiee voiced his reluctance to leave without more information, but Skywalker, unable to say for certain whether the arena warrior was indeed Fett, doubled down on the decision to escape. Chewbacca fired off a final round of support fire but left with Skywalker, Sagwa, and 3PO.[80]\\nThe rebels and Sawga encountered more hired guns. Skywalker, under fire, directed Chewbacca to commandeer a nearby speeder, which the four used to successfully return to the Falcon. The Wookiee later headed to the Falcon's cockpit, where he received a transmission from Organa, instructing the ship to return to the Rebel Fleet, as she had received a transmission from a mystery party claiming to be in possession of Solo. Chewbacca, requesting that the Jedi join him, relayed the message to Skywalker via C-3PO.[80]\\n\\nArrival at Jekara[]\\n\\n\\\"HROOOO!\\\"\\\"What? What's the matter, Chewbacca? Who's Crimson Dawn?\\\"\\\"HRRAGH! HROOO. HRRRRGH!\\\"\\\"If you will allow me to translate, Master Luke\\u2026It seems that Crimson Dawn was an extremely powerful criminal organization particularly known for tactics involving savagery and deception. While they have not been active in the galaxy for many years, Chewbacca has had dealings with them in the past. It did not go well. If they have returned and are in possession of Master Solo, it could be a very delicate and dangerous situation indeed.\\\"\\n\\u2015Chewbacca, Luke Skywalker, and C-3PO[82]\\nOrgana rendezvoused with the others aboard the Falcon, declaring it was finally time to save Solo. Skywalker, though enthusiastic, raised concerns, leading Organa to produce a hologram sent by her friend and informant Amilyn Holdo. Organa told Skywalker Hold had informed her that Solo was being held by Crimson Dawn, sending Chewbacca into a state. C-3PO translated Chewbacca for Skywalker, who was unaware of Crimson Dawn, as the Wookiee conveyed the reputation and history of the crime syndicate. The Wookiee also reluctantly suggested involving Calrissian, to which Organa gave the go-ahead. Chewbacca then departed, 3PO accompanying him.[82]\\nChewbacca spoke to Calrissian aboard the rebel frigate Redemption, where Calrissian affirmed his willingness to help. The Wookiee later piloted the Falcon through hyperspace to Jekara, where the auction was to be held. Chewbacca backed Calrissian's assessment of Crimson Dawn to Organa before announcing their arrival. Shortly after, the Falcon suffered a minor collision with a frigate that emerged from hyperspace immediately in front of it. The ship, belonging to the Black Sun, launched its fighters, which fired on and pursued the rebels' craft, leading Chewbacca to take it into Jekara's atmosphere. Navigating the planet's icy terrain, the Wookiee managed a crash landing before emerging from the Falcon with Organa and the others, the princess claiming that the team was Solo's only hope.[82]\\n\\nThe auction[]\\n\\n\\\"Though\\u2026my olfactory sensors detect the distinctive odor of singed Wookiee fur. Are you quite all right?\\\"\\\"HNGGH.\\\"\\\"Set on fire? By Boba Fett? My goodness! The pain must be extraordinary!\\\"\\\"Chewie's as tough as they come. Right, old buddy? Now hit it! Let's get out of here!\\\"\\\"HRRAGH!\\\"\\n\\u2015C-3PO, Chewbacca, and Lando Calrissian[83]\\nChewbacca, Calrissian, and Organa infiltrated the auction for Solo, only to encounter Boba Fett, who Organa ordered the Wookiee to take down quietly. Fett taunted Chewbacca with the braids of former Wookiee opponents adorning his armor, causing the hairy rebel to slam the bounty hunter into a wall, blocking Organa's line of sight with her blaster pistol. Calrissian dissuaded Organa from using a blaster and causing a disruption, instead trusting Chewbacca's superiority in hand-to-hand combat. Chewbacca tackled his opponent, but Fett torched the Wookiee with his flamethrower, leading Calrissian to put out the fire with his cape. Fett then left, desiring no further trouble.[84]\\nSeeing the host of the auction, Lady Qi'ra of Crimson Dawn, beaten by Darth Vader,[85] who had earlier arrived unannounced to claim Solo for himself,[84] Calrissian observed that the woman probably deserved what was coming to her, causing Chewbacca to object to the sentiment. Calrissian elaborated that Qi'ra's fate had been of her own making; Qi'ra wouldn't sacrifice her life for Calrissian, nor the Wookiee.[85] Vader reflected on the Heroes of Yavin, Chewbacca included, as he considered Skywalker.[86]\\nOrgana signaled Skywalker, but the Jedi was unable to fight Vader, leading Leia to formulate a plan herself. The general rallied Chewbacca, outlining  a plan in which she would occupy the Sith Lord with blaster fire from above while the Wookiee engaged him on the ground before Calrissian interrupted. As Organa and Calrissian debated, Skywalker managed to distract Vader by taunting him and fleeing in his X-wing, leading Organa, Calrissian, and Chewbacca to return to the Falcon. C-3PO, who had repaired the ship along with Lobot, inquired about the Wookiee's odd smell, to which he related the details of his fight with Boba Fett.[83]\\n\\nRebels in space[]\\nThe rebels pursued the Imperial shuttle that had taken Solo, utilizing Lobot's implants to disable it. Fett and Beilert Valance, with whom Fett had temporarily partnered, also aimed to capture Solo, and incapacitated the Falcon with a reduced\\u2013intensity seismic charge.[83] Dead in space, Chewbacca assisted Calrissian in attempting to repair the ships's systems from the cockpit. The Wookiee observed that Fett's charge had rattled the Falcon, and Calrissian concurred that it had knocked various systems offline.[87]\\nThe trio went into the bowels of the Falcon to repair the ship, which proved hazardous as the offline engines caused the reactor conduits to let off a repeating cycle of bursts. Both Organa and Chewbacca volunteered to make the repairs, but Calrissian opted to fix the problem himself, the Wookiee pulling him out at the last minute to prevent him from being fried. Calrissian told Chewbacca that the ship's diagnostic computer should be back online; the Wookiee headed to the cockpit and confirmed as much to C-3PO, who relayed the good news to Organa. Chewbacca was subsequently able to restore many of the Falcon's systems.[87]\\nThe Hutts dispatched fighters to intercept Solo, causing Chewbacca to scream at Calrissian for his role in precipitating the situation as Organa related the situation to Skywalker over the ship's comms. With the repairs made, Calrissian and the Wookiee succeeded in restarting the ships' engines. Organa noted that the point was moot\\u2014Solo had already been brought aboard the Super Star Destroyer Executor\\u2014when the Falcon received a message from the Imperial ship arranged by Qi'ra, inviting them to board.[88]\\nOnce safely aboard and welcomed by an agent of Crimson Dawn, Chewbacca participated in the rebel attack, downing stormtroopers alongside Organa and Calrissian. The rebels, heaving reached Solo, incapacitated all of the Imperials. Calrissian began trying to figure out how to defrost Solo from carbonite when the group was approached and held at blaster-point by Boba Fett. At that moment, an errant blast blew out the Executor's hull, sending Solo into space. Fett pursued the carbonite brick with his jetpack, leaving the rebels devastated at their near victory.[88]\\n\\nDawn of a revelation[]\\n\\n\\\"I\\u2026I can't believe it. Han's\\u2026alive?\\\"\\\"HRRRAOH?\\\"\\\"It's true, Chewbacca. Jabba has him.\\\"\\\"HRAAAOH!\\\"\\n\\u2015Leia Organa, Chewbacca, and Qi'ra[89]\\nOrgana later confided in Chewbacca aboard the Falcon, sharing a newfound belief that hope was \\\"for suckers,\\\" causing the Wookiee to pull her into a comforting embrace. Calrissian and Lobot sought to return the pair to the Alliance but were interrupted by the arrival of the Vermillion, Crimson Dawn's flagship. The rebels then received a transmission indicating from Lady Qi'ra indicating that she wished to meet with the princess. Organa relented, and Qi'ra boarded the Falcon, the Wookiee keeping his bowcaster trained on her until the women left to talk in private.[89]\\nThe princess later called Chewbacca to provide her with a pair of binder cuffs, intending to bring Qi'ra before a rebel tribunal. However, Qi'ra provided the revelation that Solo was alive, stunning Organa and causing the Wookiee to cry out and drop the binders. Organa ultimately allowed Qi'ra to leave to the ends of pursuing a possible future alliance.[89]\\n\\nReadying for assault[]\\n\\n\\\"Chewie's been spending his time practicing an assault on Jabba the Hutt's palace.

Leia Organa took her to the Wookiee, explaining that he was practicing a simulated assault on Jabba's palace. Chewbacca had programmed remotes to act as Jabba's sentries and vividly visualized the attack in his mind. He desired to rescue Han Solo single-handedly, a couse of action Qi'ra described as ill-advised. Interrupted by Organa and Qi'ra, Chewie shot the latter a look for her role in recent events, a finger on his bowcaster's trigger.[90]\\n\\nThe hunt for Zhara and Unity Day[]\\n\\n\\\"Hello, beast.\\\"\\\"RRGH!\\\"\\\"Shame you have to die.

[\\u2026]\\\"\\\"HROOAH!\\\"\\\"AAAH!\\\"\\n\\u2015Commander Ellian Zhara and Chewbacca[92]\\nChewbacca joined Organa in her hunt for Commander Zhara on the planet Panisia, pursuing her into a cave. One of the rebel Pathfinders offered him a knife, only for the Wookiee to reveal that he had brought one himself. The rebels eventually found Zhara, who engaged both the Pathfinders and Chewbacca in melee combat, incapacitating the former and seemingly gaining the upper hand over the latter.[92]\\nThe Imperial focused her attention on Kes Dameron and consequently turned her back on Chewbacca, who hurled her over a ledge and into a cavern below. Organa, who had been similarly displaced, pursued Zhara while Chewbacca and Dameron caught up, ultimately joining the princess in repelling a giant monster the women had found in the cave. After retrieving a datacard from Zhara, Organa left her to die, leaving the cave alongside the Pathfinder and the Wookiee.[92]\\nChewbacca later co-piloted the Millennium Falcon in an air raid on an Imperial Unity Day Parade on Bar'leth, the result of which was a major success for the Rebellion. The Wookiee later joined his squadron-mates in toasting to the victory.[93] Chewbacca also attended an intelligence briefing led by General Hera Syndulla during which Skywalker interjected, expressing a \\\"good feeling\\\" about point five, a transmission intercepted from two Imperial defectors.[94]\\n\\nSolo's rescue[]\\n\\nLeia: \\u00abI have come for the bounty on this Wookiee.\\u00bb\\nC-3PO: \\\"Oh, no! Chewbacca!\\\"\\nJabba: \\u00abAt last we have the mighty Chewbacca.\\u00bb\\n\\u2015Chewbacca is delivered to Jabba[13]\\nAware of Solo's location on Jabba's Palace, the team gradually infiltrated the fortress to rescue the Corellian: First, Calrissian infiltrated as a guard, then the droids as Skywalker's \\\"gift,\\\" then Leia Organa posing as the bounty hunter Boushh with Chewbacca as her quarry; she convinced Jabba with a thermal detonator, so the Hutt had Chewbacca imprisoned.[13]\\nThat night, Organa freed Solo from his encasement at the cost of her freedom, for Jabba had caught her red-handed, and whereas the princess was to remain at the Hutt's side, Solo was thrown in a cell together with Chewbacca, who gave him a passionate embrace, happy to reunite with his old friend, and told him that Skywalker would free them with the skills he had learned as a Jedi Knight.[13]\\n\\n     Han, Luke, and Chewbacca are sentenced to death by Jabba the Hutt.  \\nSkywalker did indeed arrive and requested an audience with Jabba by influencing the crime lord's majordomo Bib Fortuna. After Skywalker was pit against Jabba's rancor and defeated it, the enraged Hutt ordered the execution of Chewbacca, Solo and Skywalker by casting them into the Great Pit of Carkoon in the Dune Sea, to be devoured by the sarlacc that resided there. Brought to the pit in a skiff, Skywalker recovered his new lightsaber and freed Chewbacca and Solo from their bonds. However, one of Jabba's staff fired at them, injuring Chewbacca, and leaving the near-blind Solo to rescue Calrissian from falling into the pit. While Organa assassinated Jabba himself, the group went on to slay the rest of the Hutt's thugs, before destroying the crime lord's sail barge and returning to the Rebel Fleet aboard the Falcon.[13]\\n\\nEndor[]\\n\\n\\\"Keep your distance, Chewie, but don't look like you're keeping your distance. [\\u2026] I don't know \\u2013 fly casual.\\\"\\n\\u2015Han to Chewbacca during the mission to Endor\\u00a0\\u2014  Listen (file info)[13]\\nOn the meeting to debrief the Alliance on the plan to destroy the second Death Star, Chewbacca volunteered for a mission to destroy the shield generator on the forest moon of Endor, intent on following Solo, newly-appointed General of the Alliance. Joined by Organa, Skywalker, C-3PO and R2-D2, the strike team approached the moon aboard the captured Imperial shuttle Tydirium, with Chewbacca piloting the ship. As the team waited to be cleared to land by the Star Dreadnought Executor which was overseeing the blockade of the moon, Solo urged the Wookiee to \\\"fly casual,\\\" landing only after they were granted access by Darth Vader.[13]\\n\\n     Chewbacca , on Endor, with the command crew of the Endor strike team.  \\nOn the moon, they advanced through the forest and encountered Imperial scouts, to whom Solo accidentally reveal their position. Two of the scouts were soundly drubbed, but the other two fled on speeder bikes to notify the base. They were stopped by Organa and Skywalker, who were separated, prompting Chewbacca, Solo, the droids and Skywalker to search for her while the rest of the Rebel team made their way to the generator, to rendezvous with them the next morning.[13]\\nDuring their search, Chewbacca came across a dead animal on a stake, which proved irresistible bait to him. He pulled at it, springing a trap that ensnared the entire group, thus resulting in the team being captured by Ewoks. Chewbacca was forced to surrender his bowcaster and was tied to a large pole, whereas C-3PO was treated like a deity, and the group was transported to Bright Tree Village to become part of the banquet in C-3PO's honor. However, Skywalker tricked the Ewoks into thinking C-3PO had unleashed his \\\"magic\\\" by levitating him with the Force, which prompted the Ewoks to release them at once. Later that night, after C-3PO's retelling of the events of Yavin and Cloud City, Chief Chirpa declared them all part of their tribe, with one Ewok giving Chewbacca an enthusiastic hug.[13]\\nWith the tribe's help, they reached the shield generator the next morning, and Wicket told them about a secret door at the back of the facility. Chewbacca accompanied the others and successfully entered the Imperial base. However, Palpatine was aware of their plans, as were the Imperial forces stationed at the moon, who swiftly captured them as the assault against the Death Star above began. A surprise attack by the Ewoks, however, scattered the Imperial troops, distracting them long enough for Organa and Solo to take positions at the base's door, and for Chewbacca to steal AT-ST[13] Tempest Scout 2[95] with the help of two Ewoks[13] named Wunka and Widdle Warrick.[96] Using the commandeered walker, they reached the generator's back entrance, where Solo boarded the Imperial transport to broadcast a message to the generator's personnel while posing as an Imperial officer, thereby tricking the installation's crew into opening the door.[13]\\n\\n     Chewbacca and his companions celebrating the Rebel victory at Endor  \\nThanks to the success of Han Solo's ploy, the Rebel forces, Chewbacca among them, stormed the bunker, detonating explosive charges and disabling the shield generator, allowing Calrissian, Nien Nunb and Wedge Antilles to destroy the Death Star above. Chewbacca looked to the sky and cheered as he witnessed the final destruction of the battle station and, later that night, he celebrated at Bright Tree Village over a bonfire; Chewbacca danced in triumph along with his friends, old and new.[13] During the celebration, Calrissian told Solo and Chewbacca that the Falcon's sensor dish had been lost during the struggle, when Shara Bey asked him about the Pathfinders' location, to reunite with her husband, Kes Dameron.[97]\\n\\nShattering the Empire[]\\n     Chewbacca at the wedding of Han Solo and Leia Organa.  \\nFollowing the Battle of Endor, Chewbacca would join Han and their rebel companions in the Rebel Alliance's struggle against the remnants of the Empire. The morning after, he would take part in the assault on an Imperial holdout on far side of Endor, the Rebels hitting the base hard and fast, and entering to find their computers with data that signaled the war was not over yet.[97] After Solo proposed to Organa in the days after the Battle of Endor, he made sure to tell Chewbacca. Chewbacca had always suspected Solo would settle down\\u2014although Organa retorted that marrying her was the opposite of settling down\\u2014and knew his friend would end up marrying Organa, even declaring at one point to Skywalker that he would drop both on a deserted world as a means of getting them to admit their feelings. Chewbacca then attended the party Calrissian threw for Solo in honor of the wedding, taking a particular enjoyment in the food Calrissian had set out, and the wedding itself.[98]\\nTwenty days or so later,[99] Chewbacca participated alongside Solo, C-3PO, Kes Dameron, Sakas and other Rebel troops on a raid on an ISB black site at the Wretch of Tayron. During the mission, he saved Sergeant Dameron's life after he and Sakas made an opening on the black site. Chewbacca also fetched C-3PO, who had fallen behind, to enter the facility and slice its computers. The group then became aware of the concurrent Operation: Cinder and contacted Calrissian to deploy the Alliance Fleet so as to successfully aid the besieged Naboo.[12]\\n\\nNew Republic[]\\nReturn to Kashyyyk[]\\nFalse starts[]\\n\\n\\\"C'mon, Chewie. Set new coordinates. It's time to get you home.\\\"\\n\\u2015Han Solo[14]\\nNow agents of the New Republic, just as Wedge Antilles set out on a reconnaissance mission that took him to Akiva, Chewbacca and Solo went on their own mission to find the Empire's supply lines, during which they visited several planets, including Ord Mantell, Ando Prime, Kara-bin and finally Dasoor. However, Chewbacca was forced to remain on the Falcon, while Solo investigated on his own; having grown bored, he got to messing around with the ship's navigation system, trying to chase down a glitch that had been screwing up the hyperspace drive. Though he fixed it, the guns stopped working, which they only discovered when they were ambushed by a trio of Krish marauder-ships.[14]\\nHowever, as they reached Dasoor, Imra contacted the duo and informed them that they had a window of opportunity\\u2014Kashyyyk, still in the Empire's thrall, would have its blockade temporarily lifted for a few days, before its ships were replaced. Seeing Chewbacca's anxiety, Solo told Imra to gather any underworld scoundrel who owed him a favor, anyone who hated the Empire, and others in the false promise that they would obtain full pardons from the Republic, whereas Chewbacca was tasked to contact the Wookiee mercenaries, among them Roshyk, Hrrgn, and Kirratha.[14]\\nWhen Han's wife Leia learned about Han Solo's hastily-improvised plan, she tried to advice her husband and Chewbacca not to trust Imra. However, Han and Chewbacca were determined to proceed with their campaign to liberate Kashyyyk. Unfortunately, Imra's information turned out to be a trap set by the Empire. While Chewbacca attempted to board a gunship captained by Kirratha, they were attacked by two Star Destroyers and several TIE fighters. The Imperials shot out Kirratha's engines, leaving Chewbacca and Kirratha stranded in space. Han managed to escape but Chewbacca was captured and locked inside the automated Imperial prison Ashmead's Lock in the jungles of Kashyyyk. Solo traveled through Wild Space on the Millennium Falcon in attempt to find a way to free his friend.[17]\\n\\nEscaping Ashmead's Lock[]\\nLater, Solo discovered that Ashmead's Lock had been designed by the Siniteen architect Golas Aram, who resided on a secluded compound in the planet Irudiru. Han was joined by a team of rebels consisting of the New Republic starfighter pilot Norra Wexley, her son Temmin Wexley, his battle droid Mister Bones, the former Imperial loyalty officer Sinjir Rath Velus, the Zabrak bounty hunter Jas Emari, and the New Republic soldier Jom Barell. Norra and her team had been sent by Princess Leia to rescue Han. Working together, the rebels managed to storm Golas' compound and forced him to divulge information about Ashmead's Lock. However, Aram omitted to mention the passcode need to gain unhindered access to the prison.[17]\\nFollowing a struggle with Ashmead Lock's computer system SOL-GDA, Solo and Jas managed to disable the prison's power generator, which was fueled by the prisoners who were held in stasis. Solo managed to free Chewbacca and a hundred other prisoners including Norra's husband and Temmin's father Brentin Lore Wexley. Following an emotional reunion, Chewbacca stayed behind with Solo, Sinjir, Jas, and Jom while Norra, Temmin, and Mister Bones returned with the other liberated prisoners to the New Republic capital of Chandrila.[17]\\n\\nLiberation of Kashyyyk[]\\nFor the next month, Han and Chewbacca organized a campaign to hunt down Grand Moff Lozen Tolruck, the governor of Kashyyyk. Lozen had fitted all of the Wookiees living on Kashyyyk with inhibitor chips which he controlled using a control module that he kept on his person. In order to defeat Grand Moff Tolruck, Chewbacca and his rebel allies devoted their time to finding Tolruck's island fortress. Jas also recruited more Wookiee exiles and smugglers for their planned uprising. During this time, Jom was captured and imprisoned by Tolruck.[17]\\n\\n     The Liberation of Kashyyyk (a moment of the liberation pictured) finally saw Chewbacca reunited with his family  \\nWhile Chewbacca, Han, and the rest of the team infiltrated Camp Sardo, Sinjir infiltrated Tolruck's palace disguised as an Imperial officer. Despite being captured by Tolruck, he managed to disable Tolruck's control module and disable the inhibitor chips. This set off a mass Wookiee uprising all over Kashyyyk. Meanwhile, Chewbacca and his team fought off a Low-altitude Imperial transport while Jas destroyed Camp Sardo's deflector shield generator. With the aid of Han's rebel forces, the Wookiees managed to overwhelm the meager Imperial garrison on Kashyyyk.[17]\\nAfter Grand Moff Tolruck summoned the three orbiting Imperial Star Destroyers to bombard Kashyyyk, Chewbacca and his fellow rebels helped usher the liberated Wookiees into underground shelters. In response, Chewbacca along with Han, Sinjir, and Jom Barell traveled aboard the Star Destroyer Dominion. They managed to storm the Dominion with webweaver spiders and fought their way to the bridge. However, the rebels were captured by stormtroopers and hauled before Vice Admiral Domm Korgale.[17]\\nBefore Korgale could deal with the prisoners, New Republic reinforcements arrived in the form of Princess Leia aboard the Millennium Falcon, Captain Wedge Antilles and his Phantom Squadron, and Fleet Admiral Ackbar's flagship Home One. Chewbacca and his allies managed to break free from their captors and seize control of the Dominion. They then used the Dominion's cannons to destroy the nearby Vitiator. As a result, the remaining Imperial Star Destroyer Neutralizer capitulated to the New Republic. Following the liberation of Kashyyyk, Chewbacca stayed behind to reunite with his family at the insistence of Han Solo. Solo then left on the Millennium Falcon to look after his wife and his unborn son Ben Solo.[17]\\n\\nReunion with Waroo[]\\nIn the successive months, Chewbacca took part in mopping up operations against the remaining Imperial holdouts on Kashyyyk. While accompanying Greybok and several New Republic soldiers on one such operation, they stumbled upon Commandant Dessard and several Imperial soldiers preparing to execute an escaped Wookiee slave who turned out to be Chewbacca's son Lumpawaroo. The Wookiees and New Republic soldiers killed Dessard's men and took the officer prisoner. Chewbacca personally restrained Dessard by stepping over the commandant and placing a tree-trunk led on his back, forcing him to the ground. Chewbacca then experienced an emotional reunion with his lost son, who had been forced to work at a child labor camp on the slopes of Mount Arayakyak.[9]\\n\\nPeaceful retirement[]\\n\\n\\\"No. No! You have to stay here. We fought like hell for this and now\\u2026this is yours. Okay? All yours. This is home. You got people here and I want you to find them. You hear me? That's my last demand. No arguments.\\\"\\n\\u2015Han Solo to Chewbacca after liberating Kashyyyk[17]\\n     Chewbacca during the following years  \\nOnce Kashyyyk was freed from the Imperials, Chewbacca returned to his homeworld and reestablished connections with his family.[100] He settled back into a peaceful domestic life on his homeworld but kept in touch with his old friend Han Solo, who had become the business owner of a shipping company and the manager of a series of prestigious piloting championships known as the Five Sabers. Chewbacca had infrequent contact with Solo's wife Leia Organa, who had become a leading Populist senator in the New Republic's Galactic Senate.[15]\\nDuring his retirement, Chewbacca was remembered by the galaxy as a hero of the Rebellion and the New Republic.[101] Around 9 ABY, former Jedi Knight Baylan Skoll included Chewbacca by his nickname Chewie on a list of names written in a device on his gauntlet.[102]\\nFollowing the Napkin Bombing, Chewbacca sent a message via hologram to Senator Organa to wish her good recovery. After revelations about Leia's true parentage as the daughter of Darth Vader destroyed her political career, Chewbacca along with other former Rebel Alliance veterans like Ackbar, Nunb, Calrissian, and Mothma sent messages of supported to the embattled senator.[15]\\nDespite his peaceful retirement, Chewbacca decided to join him when Han Solo resumed his smuggling activities. Fortunately, the strong familial bonds and the extended lifespan of the Wookiees allowed him to spend decades away from his people.[100]\\n\\nSmuggler's Run[]\\n\\n\\\"Thing people forget about Wookiees. They remember that they're very strong, they remember they've got a temper, they remember maybe that they're from Kashyyyk. But they forget one thing.\\\"\\\"What's that?\\\"\\\"They can be very, very quiet when it suits them. Isn't that right, Chewie?\\\"\\n\\u2015Han Solo and Strater[19]\\n     Confrontation with bounty hunters in the Serendipity.  \\nChewbacca and Solo continued their partnership. Chewbacca would keep an eye out for him, including one time during which Solo engaged a trio of bounty hunters\\u2014Strater, Hove, and Rigger\\u2014sent to capture him on the Serendipity cantina, and told them about their mission to Cyrkon before they realized who he was. Once they were aware of Solo's identity, Chewbacca sneaked behind them and took hold of Rigger, only to send him flying to the Serendipity's door and knock Strater out with a punch, while Solo disarmed Bobbie. Then, the Corellian told them to warn their possible employers (Gannis Ducain, the Irving Boys, the Guavians, etc.) that they were not afraid of them, before saying goodbye to Leighton and leaving the bar together.[19]\\n\\nCold war[]\\nRecovering the Millennium Falcon[]\\n\\n\\\"Chewie, we're home.\\\"\\n\\u2015Han Solo upon entering the Millennium Falcon with Chewbacca after recapturing the freighter[16]\\n     Han and Chewie are reunited with the Millennium Falcon once again  \\nIn 31 ABY[103] the Millennium Falcon was stolen from Han and Chewbacca and they were using a Baleen-class heavy freighter, the Eravana, for their smuggling operations.[104] They eventually recovered the Falcon using their freighter's tractor beam after it was found floating in space not too far from the planet Jakku. Upon boarding their old vessel, Han and Chewbacca went about inspecting their ship and found the Jakku scavenger Rey and the defecting stormtrooper Finn hiding, whom Han assumed were the thieves that had stolen the Falcon. When Rey and Finn explained that they were going to take a droid named BB-8 to the Resistance as he had a map that would reveal Luke's location, Han and Chewbacca agreed to help them.[16]\\nUnfortunately, their freighter was boarded by two notorious criminal factions, the Guavian Death Gang and Kanjiklub, who had hired Solo on previous jobs, which he had failed to complete. Not wanting Rey and Finn to be involved, Han placed both of them in the lower corridors of the freighter while he and Chewbacca went to meet with the criminals, with BB-8 accompanying them. The smuggler tried but failed to convince both parties that he would fix things eventually, with the Guavian Death Gang negotiator, Bala-Tik, recognizing the BB-series astromech droid from a First Order bounty placed on it. They demanded that Han hand over the droid and any stowaways he might have on board. As the scuffle continued, Rey accidentally released three rathtars. Han, Chewbacca, Finn, Rey, and BB-8 managed to escape the gangs and jumped into hyperspace in the Falcon, though Chewbacca was injured from a blaster shot during the escape.[16]\\n\\nConfronting the First Order[]\\n     Chewbacca, Han and Finn are captured by the First Order on Takodana.  \\nChewbacca accompanied Han, Rey, Finn, and BB-8 to meet with Maz Kanata. After the First Order was tipped off that BB-8 was with them, they attacked Maz's castle. During the fighting at the castle, despite killing multiple stormtroopers, Han, Chewbacca, and Finn were captured by the First Order. However, the Resistance had also been tipped off, and Resistance T-70 X-wing starfighters led by Poe Dameron arrived to fight the First Order. A fierce dogfight ensued and resulted in the destruction of many First Order TIEs and the deaths of many stormtroopers from X-wing strafing runs. Ren ordered the First Order to pull out, saying they had what they came for. As the battle raged on above the castle, the remaining First Order troops boarded their ships and retreated, taking the captured and unconscious Rey along with them. Despite the First Order being driven off, Han witnessed Kylo Ren carrying Rey away. The remaining Falcon crew then rendezvoused with the Resistance at their home base.[16] There Chewbacca's wounds were treated by Resistance doctor, Major Harter Kalonia.[100]\\nAs Starkiller Base prepared to wipe out the world of D'Qar, the site of the Resistance's headquarters, the Resistance planned an attack of their own. Finn had given them Starkiller's blueprints, which revealed a critical weak point\\u2014a thermal oscillator\\u2014that, if destroyed, would eliminate the superweapon. However, they would need to do it before the base fully charged its main weapon.[16]\\n\\n     Chewbacca with Han and Finn, en route to Starkiller Base.  \\nHan Solo piloted the Falcon to Starkiller Base accompanied by Chewbacca and Finn. Their objective was to disable the shields and allow the X-wing squadron to strike, although Finn's main objective was to rescue Rey. Flying through the shields at lightspeed, the Falcon landed roughly on the edge of a cliff. Han, Chewbacca, and Finn snuck into the main base and captured Captain Phasma, who they forced to disable Starkiller's shields before disposing her in a garbage chute. They reunited with Rey, who had already escaped on her own. With the shields down, Blue Squadron and Red Squadron led by Poe Dameron commenced their assault. They fired on the base's weak point, but failed to destroy it as the First Order sent TIE fighters to stage a counterattack and throw the Resistance into chaos.[16]\\nSeeing this, Han, Chewbacca, Finn, and Rey tried to create an opening by planting thermal detonators inside the base. Han then confronted his son, Kylo Ren, named Ben Solo at birth, on a bridge over a large pit, pleading with his son to reject Snoke and return to the light side of the Force. Ben, removing his mask and seeming almost regretful, handed his lightsaber to Solo, and asked for his father's help, in which Solo replied that he would do anything for him. Ben then thrust his weapon through Han's chest. Witnessed by Rey, Finn, and Chewbacca, Han stroked his son's face for the last time, before falling to his death. Howling in fury, Chewbacca fired on Ren with his bowcaster, while Finn and Rey also fired on Ren and the surrounding stormtroopers. Chewbacca managed to land a hit on Ren's waist with his bowcaster, injuring him, but Ren managed to chase them out of the base. Chewbacca then detonated the charges, allowing Poe to fly in and destroy Starkiller's weak point thirty seconds before it drained the sun to charge its main weapon. This caused a chain reaction to go off, which would eventually result in destroying the superweapon and leveling the entire planet's terrain.[16]\\nAs Chewbacca made his exit from the base, he briefly debated upon whether to pursue and kill Kylo Ren. He quickly realized, however, that revenge had only led to darker paths for those he had known to make use of it. Thus Chewbacca quickly decided that saving those still alive was the better alternative. He quickly commandeered a snow speeder and headed back to the Millennium Falcon which was guarded by six Snowtroopers. One by one, Chewbacca took them out and entered the Falcon. The Falcon then rose from the snow and headed off to find Rey and Finn.[105]\\nShortly afterward, Chewbacca arrived with the Millennium Falcon to rescue the scavenger and Finn, who was severely wounded by Ren. They and the remainder of the Resistance fleet managed to escape Starkiller Base as it erupted into a star, and entered hyperspace to return to D'Qar.[16]\\nThe Resistance celebrated their victory while Leia, Chewbacca, and Rey mourned Han's death. R2-D2 suddenly awoke and revealed that he held the map to Luke's location, with the only piece of the map missing being the one BB-8 was given by Poe. Together they completed the map and revealed the location of the planet on which Luke Skywalker was hiding. Using this, Chewbacca, R2-D2, and Rey flew aboard the Falcon to Ahch-To, where Luke was exiled.[16]\\n\\nTime on Ahch-To[]\\n     Chewbacca on Ahch-To  \\nAfter Rey tried and failed to recruit Luke Skywalker, Chewbacca decided to help her in convincing his old friend into helping them by busting in his hut. When Luke heard of Han Solo's death, Chewbacca comforted him. Chewbacca was later seen aboard the Millennium Falcon when Luke came in to remember all the good times he had in his adventure. Later that evening, Chewbacca caught and roasted two porgs for dinner, but relented when their brethren approached him, watching sadly before scaring them away.[106]\\nDuring the Battle of Crait between the remaining forces of the Resistance and a First Order invasion army, Chewbacca piloted the Millennium Falcon, using it to lure the Order's TIE fighters away from a force of Resistance ski speeders. After the battle, he landed the ship and used it to evacuate the surviving members of the Resistance.[106]\\n\\nAdventures after the Battle of Crait[]\\nDuring the Resistance's time on Anoat, Chewbacca piloted the Millennium Falcon to save Rey after she provoked an attack by an Anoatian pit beast. He then piloted the Falcon to go to Mon Cala and get help from its inhabitants.[107]\\n\\nFirst Order-Resistance War[]\\nMission to the Sinta Glacier Colony[]\\nTraveling aboard the Millennium Falcon to the Sinta Glacier Colony, Finn and Poe Dameron engaged Chewbacca in an intense game of dejarik. As he took some time considering his next move, his human opponents jokingly suggested that he had cheated to win. The implication infuriated Chewbacca, forcing Finn and Poe to calm him. Their game was interrupted by an alarm from the cockpit, and Chewbacca ordered his opponents not to turn off the game as he left to check it, but Finn and Poe agreed that he was cheating and shut off the holochess board.[108]\\nThe Falcon arrived at the Sinta Glacier Colony, and Finn opened the docking hatch to meet a Resistance informant, Boolio, who informed them about a spy in the First Order and gave them a message in the form of a data encoder, ordering them to give it to General Organa. As First Order TIE fighters jumped into the system, the Resistance members downloaded the message into R2-D2 and made their escape. Poe damaged the Falcon in the escape, angering Chewbacca, and further infuriated him performing several lightspeed skips to shake off their pursuers.[108]\\nThe group returned to the Resistance base on Ajan Kloss bearing the knowledge they obtained from Boolio. They decoded the information, and Poe stated that Darth Sidious' return was confirmed, and that the Sith Eternal's fleet of Xyston-class Star Destroyers, the Final Order, was hiding on Exegol in the Unknown Regions, but without any leads to the true location of Exegol. Rey, however, had learned from Luke Skywalker's notes in the Jedi texts of a relic known as a Sith wayfinder that could lead to Exegol. Resolving to continue Luke's search, Rey, Finn, Poe, Chewbacca, BB-8, and C-3PO departed in the Millennium Falcon to Pasaana, where the original trail went cold.[108]\\n\\nMission to Pasaana[]\\nThe Falcon exited hyperspace over the desert planet of Pasaana and landed at Luke's coordinates near the Aki-Aki Festival of the Ancestors. Wandering among the crowd, the group attempted to lay low and blend in. Unsurprisingly, Chewbacca struggled to slouch and keep his head low. At this time, Kylo Ren established a connection with Rey through their Force-bond and stole a necklace she had received from the Aki-Aki. Rey rushed to warn her comrades that the First Order knew their location and that they needed to find the wayfinder quickly. As they prepared to escape, a lone stormtrooper confronted them before being quickly shot by a mysterious figure. Asking the team to follow him into a transport, the masked savior revealed himself to be Lando Calrissian, who had seen Chewbacca in the crowd.[108]\\nLando showed them a hologram of a Sith wayfinder and explained that only two were ever created. He further revealed that many years prior, he accompanied Luke went in search of the a Sith loyalist named Ochi, whom they believed held a key to locating one of the devices, but when they arrived, they found his ship, the Bestoon Legacy, abandoned. The old hero of the Rebellion offered them directions to Ochi's ship in the desert where he left it, as squadrons of TIEs and First Order dropships flew overhead. Chewbacca and the crew hurried through the crowds to the fringes of the festival, eventually stealing a pair of skiff speeders and attracting the attention of two First Order treadspeeders, which began a fierce pursuit aided by jet troopers.[108]\\n\\n     Chewbacca and his allies begin to sink into the Shifting Mires.  \\nThe troopers proved no match for the Resistance and were swiftly dispatched, though not before sending the stolen speeders crashing into the quicksands of the Lurch Canyon. Chewbacca and his comrades fell into a web of caves below the surface, quickly joining up as they used the glow of the Skywalker blade and Poe's diminutive flashlight to guide themselves through a series of underground tunnels. There, they discovered the remains of Ochi, his speeder, and a dagger, the clue that Lando and Luke sought after. Rey felt a very strong connection to the weapon, but couldn't quite articulate it. C-3PO identified the writing as a Sith language depicting the location of the wayfinder, but revealed that his programming restricted him from translating the script. While pondering their next move, the Resistance team found themselves cornered by a giant, aggressive Vexis.[108]\\nNoticing that the serpent was wounded, Rey approached and used the Force to heal its injuries, satiating it and providing them an exit out of the tunnels. Chewbacca took possession of the dagger, placing it in his sachel as the group headed to escape the planet in the Bestoon Legacy. Unbeknownst to Chewbacca and the crew, the Knights of Ren had arrived on Pasaana to hunt them down. Sensing Kylo Ren's presence, Rey walked out into the desert to confront him alone, but Chewbacca was captured by the Knights before he could retrieve her. The dagger was taken from him as he boarded a First Order transport. Rey and Kylo both noticed the departure of a transport, and while she used the Force to pull the ship back to the ground, Kylo counteracting her by pushing it away. In her frustration, lightning blasted from Rey's hand, destroying the transport and sending it crashing to the ground. Horrified at the thought of killing Chewbacca, Rey screamed in despair before boarding Ochi's ship with the rest of her crew.[108]\\n\\nRescue on Kijimi[]\\nAs Ochi's ship hurried away from Pasaana, the Resistance team mourned the apparent loss of Chewbacca and the dagger. C-3PO remorsefully told his companions that the dagger's inscription was only committed to his memory. they plan is made to hack into C-3PO's programming to bypass the restrictions. Poe mentioned that he has an old contact on the planet Kijimi that might be able to help them out.[108]\\nAboard the Star Destroyer Steadfast, General Hux presented to Allegiant General Pryde a \\\"valuable prisoner\\\" taken during the fighting: Chewbacca, still alive and safe aboard a different transport. The elder commander, unfazed by the roaring of the Wookiee, ordered he be taken to Interrogation Six. Shortly after, Kylo Ren returned to the Steadfast, having failed to accomplish his task set by Palpatine. On Kijimi, Poe tracked down an old contact of his, Zorii Bliss, who brought them to the droidsmith Babu Frik to override C-3PO's programming to read the Sith language on the dagger, at the cost of his memories.[108]\\n\\n     Chewbacca and his allies were nearly executed by stormtroopers on the Steadfast.  \\nDuring the process, the Knights of Ren arrived on Kijimi after following the Resistance group there. At the sight of the Steadfast in the sky, Rey sensed that Chewbacca had survived, and the group staged a rescue mission aboard the Star Destroyer with the help of Zorii. As they boarded, Rey followed the feeling that she needed the dagger, recovering it along with Chewbacca's bowcaster and bandolier. Meanwhile, Poe and Finn rescued Chewbacca, but their rescue attempt failed and resulted in their capture. Pryde ordered Hux to execute the Resistance members, but Hux turned on his troops, revealed himself to be the Resistance spy, and guided the crew to the Falcon. Before departing Kijimi, they rescued Rey from her confrontation with Kylo Ren in the Star Destroyer's hangar bay.[108]\\n\\nLoss at Kef Bir[]\\nThe group traveled to Kef Bir and Chewbacca stayed behind to repair the Falcon as Rey attempted to find the wayfinder aboard the wreckage of the second Death Star. While she eventually recovered the wayfinder, Kylo Ren arrived and destroyed it. In the ensuing lightsaber duel, both Kylo and Rey sensed the death of Leia, giving Rey the chance to defeat him and escape in his ship. Following Rey's departure, Chewbacca and the remainder of the Resistance crew boarded the Falcon along with their newfound ally Jannah and returned to their hidden base on Ajan Kloss. Upon returning, Chewbacca learned of Leia's death and mourned her along with the rest of the Resistance.[108]\\n\\nBattle of Exegol[]\\n     Maz Kanata gives Chewbacca Solo's medal.  \\nRey was able to locate Exegol with the wayfinder and transmitted her coordinates to R2. The Resistance then used the coordinates to mount a full-scale assault on the Sith fleet. The Resistance was met with formidable force as the Sith Eternal forces prepared to overtake the galaxy. Overwhelmed and hopeless, Poe apologized to the Resistance and conceded that the enemy was too formidable to defeat. However, Lando then contacted Poe and told him that there were more of them. Piloting the Falcon along with Chewbacca and Wedge Antilles, Lando led a fleet of reinforcements to aid the Resistance. During the battle, Sidious severely damaged the Resistance fleet with a massive burst of Force lightning. However, with the help of their allies and the final destruction of Sidious, the Resistance was able to defeat the remaining Sith forces and save the galaxy.[108]\\nUpon returning to Ajan Kloss, the Resistance celebrated their victory. During the celebration, Maz called Chewbacca over to her and awarded the Wookiee a medal[108] which was once worn by Han Solo.[109]\\n\\nPersonality and traits[]\\n\\n\\\"Always thinking with your stomach.\\\"\\n\\u2015Han Solo to Chewbacca\\u00a0\\u2014  Listen (file info)[13]\\n     Chewbacca crushes a stormtrooper under his foot  \\nKnown for his great strength, bravery, and loyalty, Chewbacca often served as Solo's conscience in their smuggling endeavors,[8] which made people trust him more than they did Solo.[19] However, he was also known for his stubbornness and dislike of losing.[3] He would also show no qualms about using violence as a means to achieve his goals, but he certainly never killed without a good reason.[56]\\nAs a Wookiee, Chewbacca knew passion and thus, the Rebellion, and would have stood with them from the beginning, if not for Solo and the Falcon; he would not abandon them as he was bound to both, as they were to him.[19] Few people knew that he had a mushy heart under his warrior exterior.[8] He was a kind individual and was good at reading a room.[110] Chewbacca enjoyed tinkering with mechanics, and sometimes, when he was bored, he would \\\"mess around\\\" with the Falcon's navigation system.[14]\\n\\n     Chewbacca was fiercely loyal to Han Solo, having sworn a life debt to him.  \\nWhen his friend Han Solo briefly went missing while conducting a night time search and rescue mission on the planet Hoth, Chewbacca was visibly upset and worried while he awaited Solo's return. Later, when Solo was to be encased in carbonite in Cloud City, he tried to fight to save him despite the presence of the Sith Lord Darth Vader and an Imperial security detail.[71]\\nChewbacca's desire to free his family and people led him to take part in Han Solo's campaign to liberate Kashyyyk from Imperial rule. He came up with the idea of using webweaver spiders to storm the Star Destroyer Dominion.[17] Chewbacca loved his wife Mallatobuck and son Lumpawaroo, who had been separated from him by the Empire. He and his son experienced an emotional reunion during the liberation of Kashyyyk.[9] When Lando Calrissian made a joke about Solo settling down by getting married, Solo remarked he was following Chewbacca's example, which made the Wookiee respond with a proud roar. Chewbacca nodded in agreement and had a smug expression on his face when Calrissian tipped his glass in Malla's honor, calling her a lucky woman.[98]\\nChewbacca enjoyed board games, including dejarik[3] and saigok.[111] He was known to become angry when losing such games.[3]\\n\\nSkills and abilities[]\\n\\n\\\"Chewie is an extrordinarily gifted mechanic and engineer. I've seen him fix ships that were hanging together by one wire.\\\"\\n\\u2015Lando Calrissian[110]\\n     Chewbacca was a skilled marksman with his custom bowcaster  \\nBesides the characteristic strength of his species, Chewbacca possessed exceptional skills in piloting as well as mechanic repairs, from his experience of piloting the Millennium Falcon, of which he had a great understanding of the temperamental nature of its systems.[19] Chewbacca was notably faster at operating the Falcon's controls, a fact he kept hidden from Han to prevent hurting the smuggler's ego.[105] Although not particularly meticulous, Chewbacca's technical skill allowed him to understand the inner workings of a great number of devices, including droids[71] and transmitters, being able to build one out of a wrecked starship.[21]\\n\\n     Chewbacca using two lightsabers  \\nLike many of his people, Chewbacca preferred their native bowcaster as his personal weapon. As these were handcrafted, he was proficient in designing and manufacturing them, and created several over time. The latest known bowcaster that he crafted was during the Imperial era. It was an unconventional design, as he had used the frame and power pack of a stormtrooper blaster.[34] He is also skilled in using other blaster range weapons like a SX-21 pump-action scatter blaster[7] and a sniper rifle.[11]\\nWhile rescuing Luke from Grakkus Jahibakti Tingi, R2 shot out four lightsabers to Han, Chewbacca, and Leia. Chewbacca caught two of them and used both the blue-blade and green-blade lightsaber to fight off the stormtroopers Kreel had brought in.[57]\\n\\nBehind the scenes[]\\nAppearances[]\\n\\n\\\"I sat down on one of the sofas, waiting for George.

He had a major role in both of the subsequent films of the original trilogy, Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back and Star Wars Episode VI Return of the Jedi, and also appeared in the prequel film Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith. He was portrayed in all films by Peter Mayhew, who also reprised the role for Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens[113] and its sequel, Star Wars: Episode VIII The Last Jedi.[114] Finnish basketball coach and insurance salesman Joonas Suotamo doubled as Chewbacca for some of the more physical scenes in The Force Awakens, due to Mayhew's advanced age.[115]\\n\\n     John Schoenherr's illustration (left) and Ralph McQuarrie's Chewbacca concept art (right)  \\nChewbacca was a major character in many stories of the Expanded Universe, the continuity now known as Star Wars Legends, but was killed off in the novel The New Jedi Order: Vector Prime.[116] Chewbacca's death in this publication was marked as Number One in the 2005 article 20 Most Memorable Moments of the Expanded Universe, published in the Star Wars Insider official magazine.[117] On April 25, 2014, the Expanded Universe was declared non-canon as a whole, with the only elements considered canon being the original and prequel films, the television series Star Wars: The Clone Wars, the film that launched it, and most material released after that date.[118] George Lucas placed off-limits the possibility to use Chewbacca in The Clone Wars when writer Henry Gilroy was writing the show bible,[119] though he later appeared in the third season episode \\\"Wookiee Hunt.\\\"[21]\\n\\nCreating the look[]\\n\\n\\\"I had an Alaskan Malamute when I was writing the film.

Having her with me all the time inspired me to give Han Solo a sidekick who was like a big, furry dog. Not quite like a dog, but intelligent.\\\"\\n\\u2015George Lucas[120]\\n     George Lucas (left) with Indiana, who inspired Chewbacca's creation  \\nGeorge Lucas came up with the concept of Chewbacca after people mistook Indiana, an Alaskan malamute dog owned by Lucas in the 1970s, as a human riding beside him in his car.[121] There were many early versions of Chewbacca's appearance (including one concept art that eventually became the basis of the Lasat).[122] When it was time for Ralph McQuarrie to make concept art of Chewbacca, Lucas gave him a picture of a Lemur for reference. Stuart Freeborn, the make-up artist that transformed Mayhew into Chewbacca, was given a different reference point, and he was instructed to make a creature that is a mix of a cat and a dog. Freeburn was influenced by the monkey-man creatures that he recently worked on in the 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey.[121] Chewbacca's final appearance in the movie is based on a 1976 piece of concept art by Ralph McQuarrie, which in turn was based on an illustration by John Schoenherr for George R.R. Martin's novelette \\\"And Seven Times Never Kill a Man,\\\" published in the July 1975 issue of Analog. The Schoenherr illustration also includes a weapon that became an inspiration for Chewbacca's bowcaster.[122] His final appearance became a mix of a dog, cat, lemur, and a monkey.[121]\\nIn the original draft of A New Hope, Chewbacca had a father named Auzituck. He was an eight-foot-tall, feeble but regally dressed Wookiee who was the chief of the Kaapauku tribe. The Auzituck anti-slaver gunship was named after Auzituck.[121]\\n\\n     The parts making up the Chewbacca costume.  \\nFor his appearances in the original trilogy, the Chewbacca suit, designed by Stuart Freeborn, was made out of knitted mohair (made from goat and rabbit hair) and yak hair. It would later be used and retouched during the making of Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom Menace for Senator Yarua. For his appearance in Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith, Chewbacca was completely remade, with newer, more efficient and cost-effective materials. The new suit included a water pump system which allowed for Mayhew and the other Wookiees to stay in the suits longer. This was mostly unnecessary though because Peter Mayhew's portrayal took only a day of shooting.\\nThe memorable voice of Chewbacca was designed by Ben Burtt, sound designer for all nine films. Creating Chewbacca's voice was Burtt's first job for A New Hope. He mixed together various animal growls for different emotions, including those of walruses, lions, badgers, bears,[121] seals, sea lions,[123] and sick animals. The most heavily used sound came from[121] a cinnamon bear[123] named Pooh.[121] Burtt also used a black bear named Tarik.[123] In October of 1994, Tarik passed away at the age of 16 from a combination of congestive heart failure, liver disease, and cancer.[124] Burtt also used Petula, a walrus that he recorded at the zoo.[123]\\n\\nAppearances[]\\n\\nStar Wars: Force Arena\\nStar Wars: Galactic Defense\\nQueen's Peril\\nQueen's Peril audiobook\\nStar Wars Journeys: Beginnings\\n\\u2020  5-Minute Star Wars Villain Stories\\n\\\"This is Obi-Wan\\\"\\u00a0\\u2014\\u00a0Meet the Galactic Heroes\\nStar Wars Battlefront II\\nForces of Destiny: Daring Adventures: Volume 2\\n Star Wars: The Clone Wars \\u2014 \\\"Wookiee Hunt\\\"\\nStar Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith\\nRevenge of the Sith Little Golden Book\\nAhsoka (Mentioned only)\\nAhsoka audiobook (Mentioned only)\\nSolo: A Star Wars Story\\nSolo: A Star Wars Story: Expanded Edition\\nSolo: A Star Wars Story: Expanded Edition audiobook\\nSolo: A Star Wars Story: A Junior Novel\\nSolo: A Star Wars Story: A Junior Novel audiobook\\nSolo: A Star Wars Story: Meet the Crew\\nSolo: A Star Wars Story Adaptation 1\\nSolo: A Star Wars Story Adaptation 2\\nSolo: A Star Wars Story: Train Heist\\nSolo: A Star Wars Story Adaptation 3\\nSolo: A Star Wars Story Adaptation 4\\nSolo: A Star Wars Story Adaptation 5\\n Star Wars Galaxy of Adventures \\u2014 \\\"Chewbacca -
